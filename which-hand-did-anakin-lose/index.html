<p><strong>Which Hand Did Anakin Lose</strong>. When Anakin lost his limbs he lost a lot of cells and therefore lost a lot of his ability to harness The Force. Losing a forearm and hand is not a huge loss when compared to his potential though it was a significant obstacle to overcome. Obi-Wan cuts two of General Grievous hands off as they battle on Utapau. As a young Jedi Knight Anakin lost a hand in a battle with Count Dooku which received a robotic replacement. AnakinDarth Vader lost his right hand to Count Dooku on Geonosis in Attack of the Clones.</p>

<p>Which hand of Anakin did the above cut of. After Count Dooku cut off the arm of Anakin Skywalker during the First Battle of Geonosis he had a mechno-arm grafted to what remained. He lost his cybernetic right hand yet again to Luke Skywalker on the second Death Star in Return of the Jedi. Lukes metal hand following him into the Force makes sense from the perspective that the Force Ghosts weve seen have been fully clothed and not naked. Why did Lukes hand disappear. At the climax of his epic duel with Obi-Wan Kenobi on Mustafar Vader lost both legs and his remaining biological arm to Kenobis blade and was left to die on a black sand bank.</p>

<p>After Count Dooku cut off the arm of Anakin Skywalker during the First Battle of Geonosis he had a mechno-arm grafted to what remained. Possibly the dumbest way to lose a lightsaber is by giving it away to impress someone. When they confronted Dooku Obi-Wan was knocked out of the battle quickly leaving Anakin to face off against the Sith Lord on his own. All moralities were losing ground in his head for the first time. He later returned the favor by removing both of Dookus hands. Share Improve this answer.</p>
