<p>An arithmetic sequence is a list of numbers v a definite pattern. A mens size 9 fits a foot 1031 inches long and a mens size 13 fits a foot 1171 inches long. Constant is called the common difference. A sequence in which a fixed amount is added on to get the next term. An arithmetic sequence is a sequence list of numbers that has a common difference a positive or negative constant between the consecutive terms. We can add -2 to get the next term of the sequence.</p>
<h3 id="constant-is-called-the-common-difference">Constant is called the common difference.</h3>
<p>Letter B is not an Arithmetic sequence because it has a common ratio of 3. A sequence in which a fixed amount is added on to get the next term. That means that the result of subtraction of any two consecutive terms of the sequence will always equal 25. The sum of the terms of a sequence is called a series. Try to come up with a sequence where definitions A and B produce different results. A set of numbers that follow a pattern with a specific first number.</p>
