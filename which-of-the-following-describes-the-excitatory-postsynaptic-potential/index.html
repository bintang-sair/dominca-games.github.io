<p><strong>Which Of The Following Describes The Excitatory Postsynaptic Potential</strong>. Excitatory postsynaptic potentials are excitatory because they make the postsynaptic neuron to generate an action potential by depolarizing the membrane and bringing the membrane potential closer to threshold where new action can generate It happens by opening ligand-gated Na channels in the postsynaptic membrane which then allows Na ions. 4 -Na enters cell and voltage becomes less negative. Which of the choices below describes the ANS. The opening of Na channels The closing of K channels The depolarizations of 2 or more EPSPs arriving at the same location in quick succession before the first has time to decay sum together to reach a threshold potential in what is called _____ _____. A short distance depolarization B moves membrane potential away.</p>
