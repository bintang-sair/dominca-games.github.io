<p><strong>Which Organ Is The Male Copulatory Organ</strong>. The male copulatory organ is Penis. In spiders the paired male copulatory organs are situated on the pedipalps which are paired body appendages anterior to the four pairs of walking legs. Both petasma and appendix masculina are usually referred to as copulatory organs but experimental works show that both organs may also serve to anchor the male in position while male genital papillae are directly inserted into the opening of female spermatecae and probably stimulate the female and inform the male Bauer 1996.
