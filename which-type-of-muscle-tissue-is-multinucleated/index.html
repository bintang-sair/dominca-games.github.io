<p><strong>Which Type Of Muscle Tissue Is Multinucleated</strong>. Muscle Tissue There are 3 types of muscle tissue. Muscle is one of the four primary tissue types of the body and the body contains three types of muscle tissue. They control the movements of an organisms by applying forces to different parts of the body. However cardiac muscle cells are functionally syncytium. Muscle tissue is a specialized tissue which composed of fibres of muscle cells.</p>

<p>All three muscle tissues have some properties in common. The muscular tissue is of three types. Muscle is one of the four primary tissue types of the body and the body contains three types of muscle tissue. Usually attached to bone under voluntary control each cell is a fiber that is multinucleated and striated. They are long unbranched striated and contain a developed transverse tubule system. Multinucleate cells multinucleated or polynuclear cells are eukaryotic cells that have more than one nucleus per cell ie multiple nuclei share one common cytoplasm.</p>

<p>Which muscle type does this sample contain. What type of muscle tissue is Multinucleated. They control the movements of an organisms by applying forces to different parts of the body. All three muscle tissues have some properties in common. Under the light microscope muscle cells appear striated with many nuclei squeezed along the membranes. These muscles are attached to the skeleton and help in its movement.</p>
