    "description": "Most mutations leading to cancer development occur in structural genes. The first nucleotide retains its triphosphate group while the others do not. For example inhibitors of the cell cycle keep cells from dividing when conditions arent right so too little activity of these inhibitors can promote cancer. The first nucleotide is always a cytosine. Children born to older mothers have a greater risk for cancer development.",
