<p>Long before Peaky Blinders made Cillian Murphy a true household name Danny Boyles. I vaguely remember a scene where the father of the protagonist or the protagonists friend starts to count the hair on his body and he cant stop. The Fault in Our Stars the film version of the massively popular YA novel has currently captivated the nation with its story of two beautiful teen cancer patients who fall in. Instead of using fiat money as currency a new economic system uses time as currency and each person has a clock on their arm that counts down how long they have to live. Saying everybody dies in this film is a bit of a misnomer. Almost everyone on the planet dies instantly.</p>

<p>Heather Donahue Michael C. Dont Look Up s Mid-Credits Scene Explained President Orlean and the passengers on her ship manage to get away from Earth flying to another planet. While most horror franchises incur a high bodycount very few feature a movie where everyone dies. The story concerns an American couple who go scuba diving while on vacation only to find themselves stranded miles from shore in shark-filled waters when the crew of their boat accidentally leaves them behind. April Fools Day might be the only slasher film on this list since a sub-genre focused on a group of victims being killed in consecutive order makes it difficult to have examples where no one. Thel is shot by Charlie who is then killed by Blake Conway and Johnny are killed and eaten by Cole the Trading Post Missionary is killed by Blake Nobody and Cole shoot each.</p>
