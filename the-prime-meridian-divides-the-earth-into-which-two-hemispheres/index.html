<p><strong>The Prime Meridian Divides The Earth Into Which Two Hemispheres</strong>. And It is divided along two different lines of the equator that separates the world into two halves ie the Southern and Northern Hemispheres and the Prime Meridian which divides the earth into two. A ray that divides an angle into two congruent. The Earth is a sphere that can be divided into two hemispheres Eastern and Western. The Earth can also be divided into hemispheres along meridians or lines of longitude. The Prime Meridian divides the globe into Eastern and Western hemispheres just as the equator divides the globe into Northern and Southern hemispheres.</p>

<p>The latitude that divides the Earth into Northern and Southern Hemisphere is. It divides the earth into two equal parts the Western and the Eastern Hemispheres. Which is a prime meridian and which is an anti-meridian. The Earth can also be divided into hemispheres along meridians or lines of longitude. A prime meridian is the meridian a line of longitude in a geographic coordinate system at which longitude is defined to be 0. The prime meridian is what divides the Earth into Eastern and Western hemispheres.</p>
<h3 id="what-continent-is-entirely-in-the-northern-and-western-hemispheres">What continent is entirely in the northern and western hemispheres.</h3>
<p>The region east of the Prime Meridian is the Eastern hemisphere and the reason west of the Prime Meridian is the western hemisphere. The prime meridian is what divides the Earth into Eastern and Western hemispheres. The Earth can also be divided into hemispheres along meridians or lines of longitude. This is similar to the way the Equator serves as the 0 latitude line and divides the Earth into the northern and southern hemispheres. The Prime Meridian is an imaginary line that similar to the equator divides the earth into eastern and western hemispheres. The northern and the southern hemispheres are two hemispheres of the earth that are divided by the 0-degree latitude called the Equator.</p>
