<p>Binary Ionic Compound Binary ionic compounds are salts which consist of only 2 elements. For example sodium iodide NaI is composed of sodium ions Na elemental sodium is a metal and iodide ions I elemental iodine is a nonmetal. Ionic compounds come under covalent compounds when we analyse the chemical compounds. A binary ionic compound is composed of ions of two different elements - one of which is a metal and the other a nonmetal. Binary ionic compounds tend to have relatively high melting and boiling points due to the ionic bond. A binary ionic compound is a compound composed of a monatomic metal cation and a monatomic nonmetal anion.</p>
