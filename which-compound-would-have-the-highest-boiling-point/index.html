<p><strong>Which Compound Would Have The Highest Boiling Point</strong>. Ion-dipole interaction occurs between an ion and a polar covalent compound. Carbon has the highest melting point at 3823 K 3550 C and Rhenium has the highest boiling point at 5870 K 5594 C. The simplest reason is ceF the highest electrnegative atom and capable of having strongest hydrogen bonding. The combination of the forces from a carbonyl and the alcohol to produce the COOH enables it to have the strongest intermolecular forces London forces dipole dipole and hydrogen bonding which in turn indicate the highest boiling point. Water has a simple molecular structure.</p>

<p>This is because they require more energy to be able to break the bonds during the phase transition. Alcohol are found to have boiling point approximately as 7837. Water has a simple molecular structure. Recall that there are several types of intermolecular forces. NaCl is an ionic compound and exists as a solid at room temperature due to the strong ionic bonds that exist between the oppositely charged ions. 1 M AlC l 3 solution will have the highest boiling point is because colligative properties such as elevation in boiling point is directly proportional to number of particles in solutions and AlC l 3 produces highest number of particles or ions.</p>
<h3 id="carbon-has-the-highest-melting-point-at-3823-k-3550-c-and-rhenium-has-the-highest-boiling-point-at-5870-k-5594-c">Carbon has the highest melting point at 3823 K 3550 C and Rhenium has the highest boiling point at 5870 K 5594 C.</h3>
<p>The compound with the highest intermolecular forces will have the highest boiling point. Carboxylic acids contain the highest boiling points out of the organic compounds covered. Propan-1-ol has the highest boiling point because propan-1-ol contains H-bonding in their structure. Carbon has the highest melting point at 3823 K 3550 C and Rhenium has the highest boiling point at 5870 K 5594 C. What Compound Has The Highest Boiling PointThe hydrogen bond has stronger intermolecular forces. Ion-dipole interaction occurs between an ion and a polar covalent compound.</p>
