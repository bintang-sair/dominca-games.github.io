<p><strong>Which Carbocation Is Most Stable</strong>. A tertiary carbocation forms the most quickly because it is the most stable. Therefore structures with resonance are far better stabilised than others. We have one more case in this example with primary carbocations 1 and 5. Answer 1 of 11. N O2 and Cl.</p>

<p>Resonance effects can further stabilise carbocations when present therefore allyl or benzyl carbocations are more stable than simple. Cyclopropane carbocation is exceptionally very stable due to dancing resonance. Beside this which is more stable carbocation. This is due to orbital overlap between the σbond and the empty p orbital on the sp2 carbon. Increasing substitution increases the hyperconjugation and thus it increases stability. Answer 1 of 6.</p>
<h3 id="therefore-a-primary-vinylic-carbocation-is-less-stable-than-a-primary-alkyl-carbocation">Therefore a primary vinylic carbocation is less stable than a primary alkyl carbocation.</h3>
<p>The carbocation 1 is a saturated carbocation which is stabilized by hyperconjugation. Therefore a primary vinylic carbocation is less stable than a primary alkyl carbocation. A tertiary carbocation forms the most quickly because it is the most stable. Primary carbocations are highly unstable and not often observed as reaction intermediates.

<p>In the first question the most stable carbocation is the one in which the positive charge is on a tertiary carbon atom because a tertiary carbocation is more stable than primary or secondary carbocation because of the electron donatind tendency of the methyl groups.</p>
