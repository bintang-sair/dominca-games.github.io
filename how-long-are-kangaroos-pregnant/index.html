Once the Egg cell is fertilized it takes 28 34 days of gestation to be ready for birth. At the end of the pregnancy the expectant mother takes up a sitting position and grooms her pouch. Red kangaroos leave the pouch for good at around eight months and continue to suckle for another three to four months. The baby emerges from an opening at the base of her tail called the cloaca.",
