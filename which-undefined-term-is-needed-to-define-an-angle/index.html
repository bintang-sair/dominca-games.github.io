<p><strong>Which Undefined Term Is Needed To Define An Angle</strong>. The three undefined terms in geometry are point line and plane. From the term line the term angle can be defined because when two lines intersect at a point an angle is formed. An angle is formed by two rays with the same midpoint. Therefore the undefined term which is. Theorems can be proven.</p>

<p>The sum of the interior angles of a triangle is 180 degrees of a quadrilateral is 360 degrees and of a pentagon is 540 degrees. Which undefined term is needed to define an angle. Point line and plane. An angle is formed by two rays with the same midpoint. In geometry an angle can be defined as the figure formed by two rays meeting at a common end point. Therefore the undefined term which is.</p>
<h3 id="which-undefined-term-is-used-to-define-an-angle">Which undefined term is used to define an angle.</h3>
<p>A point can be small or quite large and it will still represent a point. A line is defined as something that extends infinitely in either direction but has no width and is one dimensional while a plane extends infinitely in two dimensions. Get the detailed answer. The three undefined terms in geometry are point line and plane. The mathematical term parallel lines explicitly use the undefined terms. Point is the undefined term needed to define an angle.</p>
