<p><strong>Which Of The Following Is The Weakest Base</strong>. A Ammonia is the weakest reducing agent and the strongest base among Group 15 hydrides. Benzenamine is the weakest base among the following since the delocalisation of the lone pair of electrons in it is not possible due to which the electron density on the molecule is fairly low and the compound acts as the weak base in the presence of the acid. So Ca OH2 have strongest lattice - dissociates least -. So it does not readily donate an electron pair making it the weakest Lewis base.

So the reason is that in this ring a double bond is not present to develop conjugation thats why. The appropriate method however is to add H to each base and check the strength of the acid. Benzenamine is the weakest base among the following since the delocalisation of the lone pair of electrons in it is not possible due to which the electron density on the molecule is fairly low and the compound acts as the weak base in the presence of the acid. This means compound must have a strong LATTICE.</p>
