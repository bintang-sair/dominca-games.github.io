On average a piece of heavily processed cardboard will take about 5 years to decompose. If present in nature fallen leaves take long 46months to decompose due to lack of subtle environment for microbes but when composting by humans it takes less time 23 months as it is regularly supplied with water for microbes to expand and regular turnovers.",
