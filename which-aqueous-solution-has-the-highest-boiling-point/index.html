<p>001 M Na 2 SO 4. 1 Expert Answer NaNO3 has the lowest vapor pressure due to its ion-dipole interaction being greater than that of LiC2H3O2 and NH 4 SO 4. So elevation in boiling point will be above a boiling point of water for all solutions. Based on ideal behavior which of the following aqueous solutions has the highest boiling point and lowest freezing point. Therefore the change in temperature T will be proportional to the product of the vant Hoff factor i and the molality m. The ph of the solution is.</p>
