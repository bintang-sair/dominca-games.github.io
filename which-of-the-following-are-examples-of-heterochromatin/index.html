Euchromatin is defined as the area of the chromosome which is rich in gene concentration and actively participates in the transcription process. In heterochromatin formation which of the following are responsible for recruiting histone deacetylases and histone methyltransferases to a nucleation site. Heterochromatin remains relatively condensed throughout the cell cycle and condenses early in cell division.",
