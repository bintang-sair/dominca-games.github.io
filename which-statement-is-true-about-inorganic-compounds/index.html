<p><strong>Which Statement Is True About Inorganic Compounds</strong>. They are all - 17241717. Eventhoug there are some inorganic compounds that contain carbon not all do and theyre all made of atoms inorganic compounds are made out of two or more elemens thats why the answer is they are not made from living things. To organic chemistry as polyatomic ions are to inorganic chemistry. Plants convert solar energy into chemical energy which is stored in them. Both A and B.</p>
