<p><strong>Achiral Compounds Are Those Which</strong>. 12 Stereoisomers that are nonsuperimposable mirror images of each other are known as _____. E have a carbon attached to four different atoms. Meso compounds are achiral optically inactive diastereomers of chiral stereoisomers. So the compounds which do not show such type of property does not rotate plane polarised light are optically inactive and are called achiral. Tartaric acid HOCCHOHCHOHCOH was an important compound in the history of stereochemistry.</p>

<p>This geometric property is called chirality. A meso compound is an achiral compound that has chiral centers. The key difference between the terms achiral and meso is that achiral compounds have no chiral centers whereas meso compounds have multiple chiral centers. The molecules discussed in the previous section are achiral because they possess either a plane of symmetry or a center of symmetry. Ie to be simple mesomers are type of organic compounds where two chiral carbons are present and those two are similar so net rotation is zero. The human body cannot use L-glucose.</p>

<p>The key difference between the terms achiral and meso is that achiral compounds have no chiral centers whereas meso compounds have multiple chiral centers. Meso compound an achiral compound possessing two or more chiral centers that also has chiral isomers. It is possible to make L-glucose its mirror-image by chemical synthesis. Chiral Compound - An asymmetric carbon atom chiral carbon is a carbon atom that is attached to four different types of atoms or groups of atoms and the Compound called Chiral compound. Are a racemic mixture. Mesomers are a type of compounds in which net rotation of plane polarised light is zero.</p>
