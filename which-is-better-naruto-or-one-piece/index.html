<p><strong>Which Is Better Naruto Or One Piece</strong>. As naruto and i just waisted 500 ep of my time watching boring one piece and think abt it ould u rather watch ninjas or silly pirates. One Piece also has some amazing fights but its not the focus of the series its an adventure series. And NOOne Piece is highly popular only in Japan. For fights Naruto is definitely a more combat oriented story being a battle series. I do enjoy One Piece more than Naruto because the writing quality is generally higher and its focus on adventure prevents it from being bogged down by too much drama.</p>

<p>Naruto is clearly way better than one piece. We have been given some amazing fights though but they just dont stack up to Naruto. Much of this has to do with special effects that are less frequent in One Piece than Naruto. One Piece vs Naruto. Naruto Bleach and One Piece were three of the most popular manga that was signed on to the magazine for the longest time but only the last name is still going strong as of this day. Im not sure if One Piece is better or not but One Piece is definitely more consistent than Naruto.</p>
<h3 id="one-thing-i-give-kishimoto-major-credit-for-is-taking-the-massive-risk-of-removing-naruto-from-the-main-characters-seat-for-a-year-and-a-half-in-favor-of-sasuke-and-for-a-short-while-jiraya">One thing I give Kishimoto major credit for is taking the massive risk of removing Naruto from the main characters seat for a year and a half in favor of Sasuke and for a short while Jiraya.</h3>
<p>Music in both Naruto and Shippuden is just awesome especially Shippuden. Still in a comparison between the two we would say that Naruto is the better anime due to its character development depth and overall story. We have been given some amazing fights though but they just dont stack up to Naruto. Meanwhile both Bleach and Naruto ended their runs on rather mediocre notes although one might argue that the latters conclusion was still more warmly received than the former. Naruto is way better than one piece i mean one piece is good but not as good. I would go as far as to say anyone reading One Piece for the fights is reading for the wrong reasons.</p>
