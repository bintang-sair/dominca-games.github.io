<p>Biosphere Living Things All the living things in the planet are categorized under the biosphere. In one way or another all components of the cryosphere interact with and influence the ocean. Landform A is a ridge and Landform B is a plateau. A large part of the Earths water exists in its solid form. Glaciers not only transport material as they move but they also sculpt and carve away the land beneath them. The cryosphere includes lake and river ice sea ice snow cover glaciers ice caps ice sheets and water frozen in soil known as permafrost permafrost.</p>
