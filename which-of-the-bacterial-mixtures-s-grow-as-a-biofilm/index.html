<p>Cells deep in the biofilm are therefore protected against the antibiotic. To determine this you perform a bacterial growth study looking at the number of viable bacteria cells remaining after treatment with penicillin an antibiotic. For example over 500 bacterial species can live on typical dental plaque biofilms. Dimethyl methylene blue DMMB dye was used to quantify biofilm matrix colorimetrically. A number of processes can contribute to spatial heterogeneity in a growing biofilm. Therefore bacteria in the deeper segments of the biofilm persist and perpetuate the infection.</p>

<p>To determine this you perform a bacterial growth study looking at the number of viable bacteria cells remaining after treatment with penicillin an antibiotic. They also commonly contain fungi algae yeasts protozoa and other microorganisms. Bacterial cell exhibit two types of growth mode ie. Previous studies have demonstrated that eDNA is a key constituent in the construction and structural integrity of the biofilm matrix in many bacterial species and the cleaving of eDNA by nuclease enzymes such as DNase I disintegrates the biofilm matrix thereby increasing the susceptibility of bacterial cells within the biofilm matrix to antimicrobial agents. A biofilm structure is composed of metabolically active both resistant and tolerant and non-active cells viable but not culturable cells and persisters as well as polymer matrix consisting of polysaccharide extracellular DNA and proteins. Aureus 1206 was used.</p>
