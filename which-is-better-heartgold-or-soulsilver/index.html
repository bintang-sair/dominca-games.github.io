<p><strong>Which Is Better Heartgold Or Soulsilver</strong>. Ive never trusted Gyarados so much specially before megaevolutions XY and ORAS became a thing. But thats just a personal preference since it was literally the first gen 4 game I played. Unless you got the event In the main story in Heartgold you go to Bell Tower first in Soulsilver you go to Whirl Islands. If you prefer one of the strongest types of the games Id suggest Soul Silver though. You get both in either game the non-mascot is just later in the game and is stronger.</p>

<p>SoulSilver is said to be a more challenging game and that seems to be the consensus in the forums. Unless you got the event In the main story in Heartgold you go to Bell Tower first in Soulsilver you go to Whirl Islands. In Heartgold you get Latias and in Soulsilver you get Latios.

<p>In truth the answer is subjective. Posted May 9 2012 edited This is a tier list for Pokemon HeartGold and SoulSilver however this list is unique in that it is specifically designed for a Nuzlocke playthrough. SoulSilver is a harder game and it is better for people that like a real challenge. The plot of Pokémon HeartGold and SoulSilver is mostly the same but there are some differences in Pokemon such as Ho-Oh. And Ho-Oh and thus HeartGold has a better story than Lugia and SoulSilver in my kind of biased opinion even if they do overlap. Version-exclusive Pokémon in HeartGold SoulSilver.</p>
