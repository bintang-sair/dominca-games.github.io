<p><strong>For Anaphase To Begin Which Of The Following Must Occur</strong>. B Cohesin must attach the sister chromatids to each other. After M phase completes cell division occurs and two cells are left and the cell cycle can begin again. Although the chromosomes were heavily condensed in the start of cell division they continue to condense. Beside above what happens during. Before a cell can begin mitosis it must grow and create proteins RNA and copies of DNA.</p>
