<p><strong>Which Muscle Tissue Is Multinucleated</strong>. The cells of cardiac muscle known as cardiomyocytes also appear striated under the microscope. Skeletal muscles maintain posture stabilize bones and joints control internal movement and generate heat. A 7-year-old girl presents with bilateral swelling of the mandible and maxilla. There are 3 types of muscle cells in the human body. Skeletal muscle fibers are long multinucleated cells.</p>

<p>Cardiac skeletal and smooth. Composed of bundles of very long cylindrical multinucleated cells that show cross-striations. Muscle cells commonly known as myocytes are the cells that make up muscle tissue. The cells are multinucleated as a result of the fusion of the many myoblasts that fuse to form each long muscle fiber. Cardiac muscle forms the contractile walls of the heart. Cardiac muscle has branching fibers one.</p>

<p>Blood vessels and nerves enter the connective tissue and branch in the cell. Skeletal muscle fibers are long multinucleated cells. The cells are multinucleated as a result of the fusion of the many myoblasts that fuse to form each long muscle fiber. Skeletal muscle cells are multinucleated from the fusion of muscle cells. Muscle cells commonly known as myocytes are the cells that make up muscle tissue. Muscles attach to bones directly or through tendons or aponeuroses.</p>
