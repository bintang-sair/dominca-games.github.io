<p>-Which of the following is true of the relationship between anabolic pathways and. They are usually spontaneous chemical reactions. Choice - Chapter 6 - Question 3 Part A Which of the following is true for anabolic pathways. B They consume energy to build up polymers from monomers. D They are usually highly spontaneous chemical reactions. C They release energy as they degrade polymers to monomers.</p>
<h3 id="b-they-do-not-depend-on-enzymes">B They do not depend on enzymes.</h3>
<p>A They are usually spontaneous chemical reactions. CPathways that synthesize larger biomolecules from smaller ones are known as anabolism. D They decrease the entropy of the organism and its environment. C They release energy by degrading polymers to monomers. BAs a rule the anabolic pathway by which an organism makes a substance is the exact reverse of the catabolic pathway. 2-ATP is a common intermediate between catabolic and anabolic pathways.</p>
