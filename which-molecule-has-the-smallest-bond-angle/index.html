<p><strong>Which Molecule Has The Smallest Bond Angle</strong>. This image suggests a bond angle of 1067 which apparently is the smallest here. In which substance is hydrogen bonding present. Which one of the following compounds has the smallest bond angle in its molecule. The bond angle in NH3 is smaller larger than the bond angle in CH4 because 1. Where is the central atom located in a trigonal bipyramidal molecule.</p>

<p>This is because as we move down the group the size of the central atom increases and the force of attractions between the atoms increases hence. Bond Angle is the angle formed by two connected atoms and the central atom. In the center of the plane shared by two triangular pyramids and at the point where the equatorial and axial bonds meet. The difference in angles si due to presence of one and two lone pairs in ammonia and water. As the electron density around the central atom decreases the repulsion between electron pair decreases Hence the bond angle decreases in the order N H 3 P H 3 H 2 S H 2 S e Therefore the smallest bond angle is of H 2 S e. 700 153k The correct order of bond angles smallest first in is.</p>
