<p><strong>Which Heterocycles Are Aromatic</strong>. Heterocyclic aromatic amines HAAs are a class of compounds in the diet that are receiving widening attention as a risk factor for human cancer. They number among some most significant compounds for human beings especially in medicinal field. Different Nitrogen oxygen and sulfur are the primary elements seen in common heterocycles. A purine such as adenine A and guanine G is characterized by double-ring structures and a pyrimidine such as cytosine C and thymine T is. And heterocycles cycles can be aromatic too.</p>

<p>Aromatic Heterocycles Heterocycles that have aromatic character or that fulfil basic rules of aromaticity are known as Aromatic Heterocycles. Youll commonly see oxygen nitrogen and even sulfur in heterocyclic aromatic compounds. The names of six - membered aromatic heterocycles. Heterocyclic aromatic amines HAAs are a class of compounds in the diet that are receiving widening attention as a risk factor for human cancer. Probably about two-third of organic compounds belong to this class. Only the R -enantiomer occurs naturally.</p>
