<p><strong>Which Organelle Contains Hydrolytic Enzymes</strong>. A lysosome contains a specific composition of both its. A lysosome ˈlasˌsom is a membrane-bound organelle found in many animal cells. The nucleus is the brain of a cell. A lysosome has a specific composition of both its membrane proteins and its lumenal proteins. It contains many hydrolytic enzymes which are responsible for the destruction process.</p>

<p>In animal cells which of the following organelles contains these hydrolytic enzymesa lysosomeb chloroplastc central vacuoled peroxisome. Lysosomes contain hydrolytic enzymes bound within membrane and are involved in the intracellular digestive process. Lysosomes contain portions of cytoplasmic components such as glycogen mitochondria or cisternae of the endoplasmic reticulum. There are many types of hydrolytic enzymes. The organelle that contain hydrolytic enzymes is lysosomes and it is formed from the Golgi apparatus in the form of secretory vesicles. Why lysosomes are called suicidal bags.</p>
<h3 id="lysosomes-are-membrane-bound-organelles-and-the-area-within-the-membrane-is-called-the-lumen-which-contains-the-hydrolytic-enzymes-and-other-cellular-debris">Lysosomes are membrane-bound organelles and the area within the membrane is called the lumen which contains the hydrolytic enzymes and other cellular debris.</h3>
<p>A lysosome is a membrane-bound organelle that can be found in many animal cells. Note- Lysosomes are cell organelles that contain different types of hydrolytic enzymes that help in intracellular as well as extracellular digestion. Ribosomes do not have a membrane and are either free structures. Lysosomes are membrane-bound organelles which are capable of breaking down biomolecules such as proteins nucleic acids carbohydrates and lipids. Lysosomes are the suicidal bags of cell that have hydrolytic enzymes and serve to digest and remove the wear and tear organelles and molecules from the. Which of the following organelles contains these hydrolytic enzymes in animal cells.</p>
