<p><strong>How Long Can Turtles Stay Out Of Water</strong>. Both snapping turtles and painted turtles can survive forced submergence at cold water temperatures in the lab for well over 100 days. If the area has a cool temperature a turtle can stay out of the water for a couple days. On a side notethe Fitzroy River turtle can remain underwater almost indefinitely because of their adapted cloaca which helps them extract oxygen from the water in other words they can breathe through their butts.

While holding their breath their heart rate slows significantly to conserve oxygenup to nine minutes can pass between heartbeats. Aquatic turtles cannot retain heat for as long as terrestrials.</p>
