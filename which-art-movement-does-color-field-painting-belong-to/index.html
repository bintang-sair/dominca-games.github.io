<p><strong>Which Art Movement Does Color Field Painting Belong To</strong>. King Menkaure Mycerinus and queen. The painting seems to extend beyond the canvas as though it is a field. Color Field painting brought the idea of color as a subject into the world of modern art. It was somehow meant to encompass not only the work of painters who filled their canvases with fields of color and abstract forms but also those who attacked their canvases with a vigorous gestural expressionism. This group of London artists were notorious for their willingness to shock audiences through their imagery and a willingness to push beyond limits of decency.</p>

<p>With the rise of Abstract Expressionism New York became the art center of the world where it had been Paris France in years past. The Action Painters for example Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning are the loud siblings the extroverts. They are the quieter siblings the introverts. The term Colour Field painting refers to a particular style of American Abstract Expressionism associated with the New York School of modern art. It was pioneered in the late 1940s by Mark Rothko Barnett Newman and Clyfford Still who were all independently searching for a style of abstraction that might provide a modern mythic art and express a yearning for transcendence and the infinite. Color Field Painting was called Post-Painterly Abstraction by Clement Greenberg.</p>

<p>It was somehow meant to encompass not only the work of painters who filled their canvases with fields of color and abstract forms but also those who attacked their canvases with a vigorous gestural expressionism. In this type of abstract painting there is no background. Art movements were especially important in modern art when each consecutive movement was considered as a new avant-garde movement. The painting seems to extend beyond the canvas as though it is a field. Again originating from France this type of art developed between 1886 and 1905 as a response to the Impressionist movement. Pop Art In this return to representational art the artist returns to the world of tangible objects in a reaction against abstraction.</p>
