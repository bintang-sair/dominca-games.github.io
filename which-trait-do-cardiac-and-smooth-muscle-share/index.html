Not only would it be nearly impossible to make a conscious decision to activate our heart and smooth muscles but the responsibility would be too much.",

<p><strong>Which Trait Do Cardiac And Smooth Muscle Share</strong>. Cardiac and smooth muscles are types of involuntary muscles which means they work regardless of what you are doing and require no conscious thought to do their jobs. Voluntary involuntary nonstriated striated. The cardiac muscles are in the heart and theskeletal help move. Skeletal muscles control his leg movement and cardiac muscles control his heart rate. Cardiac muscle also known as.</p>

<p>Did you get the answer. Cardiac muscle is unique because it is striated like skeletal muscle yet involuntary like smooth muscle. Smooth muscles move internal organs of the body such as bowels and vessels to facilitate body functions such as digestion urination and breathing. Cardiac muscles comprise branching chains of cells which are connected by porous intercalated discs with a single nucleus. Voluntary involuntary nonstriated striated. There are 3 types of muscle cells in the human body.</p>

<p>Voluntary involuntary nonstriated striated. Cardiac muscle is unique because it is striated like skeletal muscle yet involuntary like smooth muscle. The internal organs on the other hand with the exception of the heart are made of smooth muscle which works without conscious effort. Did you get the answer. Theyre both involuntary HernanJe6. Skeletal muscle controls the bodys movement and is generally under conscious or voluntary control.</p>
