In NH 3 H is less electronegative than N and hence dipole moment of each NH bond is towards N and create high net dipole moment where as in NF 3 F is more electronegative than N the dipole moment of each NF bond is opposite to that. Hence the option C is the correct answer. In the case of C H C l 3 one of the Cl cancels the dipole moment of the opposite Cl atom so.

<p>When a system has charge separation the dipole moment arises. LiCl will have a lower boiling point than LIF because the coulombic attractions are weaker in LiCl than in LiF. CHCl3 is having the maximum dipole moment because in the tetrahedral structure all the Cl will be at the bottom and will lead to the addition of their individual dipoles. The direction of the dipole moment in a bond is towards the more electronegative atom. A CIF b PCl 3 c SiF 4 d Cl 3 CF. The bond dipole moment is a vector quantity as it has magnitude and direction.</p>

<p>LiCl will have a lower boiling point than LIF because the coulombic attractions are weaker in LiCl than in LiF. Which of the following molecules has highest dipole moment. In NH 3 H is less electronegative than N and hence dipole moment of each NH bond is towards N and create high net dipole moment where as in NF 3 F is more electronegative than N the dipole moment of each NF bond is opposite to that. Dipole moment is a vector quantity that means it has a direction as well as magnitude. One mole of any substance contains 60221023 atomsmolec. Learn more about dipole.</p>
