<p><strong>Which Compound Is The Most Soluble In Water</strong>. Water is a polar molecule that exhibits hydrogen bonding so the best solute is another polar compound. Lead chloride is also insoluble in cold water but is soluble in hot water. Which compound is soluble in water and why. In other words ethanol is soluble in water because it is a polar solvent. Lead sulfate is insoluble in cold water whereas most of the sulfates are soluble in cold water.</p>

<p>Part B Identify the compound in the following group that is most soluble in water Rank the compounds from most soluble in water to least soluble in water. Greater is the number of hydrogen bonds greater is the extent of hydrogen bonding and greater is the solubility in water. Which compound is the most soluble in water. Ethylene glycol has two hydroxy groups both of which form hydrogen bonds with water. Lead chloride is also insoluble in cold water but is soluble in hot water. Carboxylic acids are soluble in water because they can form hydrogen bonds with water.</p>

<p>OCH -O-CH O CH2-OH OCH CH CH CH3 -CH2-OH. Which compound is soluble in water and why. Were being asked to determine the compound that is most soluble in water. Ethylene glycol has two hydroxy groups both of which form hydrogen bonds with water. Remember that carboxylic acids dissolve. The number of hydrogen bonds is higher the hydrogen bonding strength is greater and the water solubility is also high.</p>
