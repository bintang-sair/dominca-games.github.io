<p>If A B and C are molecules and C is a larger molecule than A and B which of the two reactions is a dehydration reaction. Assembling molecules in either carbonyl or carboxyl functional groups Assembling molecules in either hydroxyl or carboxyl functional groups Dissembling molecules in carboxyl functional groups Dissembling molecules in hydroxyl. Carbohydrates proteins and nucleic acids are built up and broken down via these types of reactions although the monomers involved are different in each case. These reactions are known as dehydrogenation or dehydration of alcohols. An oxidative decarboxylation a dehydration and a condensation d. Carboxyl groups are functional groups with a carbon atom double-bonded to an oxygen atom and single bonded to a hydroxyl group.</p>
