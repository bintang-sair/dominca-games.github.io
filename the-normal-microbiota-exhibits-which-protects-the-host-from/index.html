<p>The microbiota has emerged as a key regulator of metabolism within the mammalian host and the composition of the microbiota in obese individuals is sufficient to confer metabolic defects when transferred into mice. Recently several studies have begun to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying how the gut microbiota regulates host innate immunity against pathogens 16 17 including a role in helping the host resist pathogen colonization. In kernel as the Microbe acquires a stable part of foods stable environment protection and involvement the host besides obtains single nutritionary and digestive additions every bit good as the development and natural action of the immune system which protects it against the infective infection by the bugs.
