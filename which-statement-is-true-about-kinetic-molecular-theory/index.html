<p>What scientific concept do you need to know in order to solve this problem. Molecules of different gases with the same mass and temperature always have the same average kinetic energy. A The collisions of particles with one another is completely elastic B The size of the particle is large compared to the volume C A single particle does not move in a straight line D The average kinetic energy of a particle is not proportional to the temperature. A single particle does not move in a straight line. B The size of the particle is large compared to the volume. The theory assumes that gases consist of widely separated molecules of negligible volume that are in constant motion colliding elastically with one another and the walls of their container with average velocities determined by their.</p>
