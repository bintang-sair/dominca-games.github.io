<p><strong>Which Similarity Is Not Shared Between Algae And Plants</strong>. They both have cell membranes constructed from a phospholipid bilayer. They are not as differentiated as plants. Despite this they do share similar cellular structures Figures 1 and 2. The cyanobacteria cell wall is made of peptidoglycan while the plant cell wall is made of cellulose. However that is where the differences end as algae lack many structural components typically present in plants such as true stems shoots and leaves.</p>

<p>Three similarities between modern green algae and plants include both store food as starch and both have cell walls made of cellulose. The moss lifecycle follows the pattern of alternation of generations as shown in Figure. The key difference between algae and plant is that algae can be unicellular or multicellular while plants are always multicellular. Therefore algae are simple life forms whereas plants are complex organisms. Both use chlorophyll in chloroplasts for photosynthesis too. Even though algae are similar to plants in certain ways they are officially labeled as protists because they are eukaryotic which means that they have a nucleus however they do not perfectly fit the requirements to be classified as animals fungi or plants.</p>
<h3 id="they-are-not-as-differentiated-as-plants">They are not as differentiated as plants.</h3>
<p>There are familiar green algae in both groups. No algae and plant cells have some similarities but they are not the same. Anatomically they are similar to another major group of photosynthetic organisms the land plants. Photosynthesis-related pathways are regarded as a promising avenue for crop. The algae do not have true tissues meaning tissue as a group of specialized cells that perform a specific function. CELL STRUCTURES The structural make-up of cells from green algae and plants share similarities in terms of their materials and the types of cell.</p>
