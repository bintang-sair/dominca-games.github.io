<p><strong>How Long Does Leg Hair Take To Grow Back</strong>. How long does it take for a dogs leg hair to grow back. I had a patch of hair on my leg shaved once it took a lot longer to grow back than any other hair like three months total. After about a month real hair will begin to grow back at its normal rate of 6 inches per year. If you pluck a hair that is in the final portion. This is because hair grows in cycles.</p>

<p>As soon as the telogen phase is complete the anagen phase begins anew. Where your hair is in this cycle will influence how long the tweezing will last. Each winter my leg hair grows back as usual and thats after shaving my legs for about eight years. My guess is that it would take leg hair a few weeks to about a month or so to get back to its regular length. If anything my leg hair grows back thinner. You can have smooth skin for at least 3 to 6 weeks.</p>
<h3 id="on-the-bright-side-even-if-they-do-grow-again">On the bright side even if they do grow again.</h3>
<p>During the growth portion of the cycle body hair follicles are long and bulbous and the hair advances outward at about a third of a millimeter per day. Where your hair is in this cycle will influence how long the tweezing will last. You will have to see if the hairpiece is comfortable on your legs. Realistically you will probably have to get touch ups at least every two weeks with any of these methods. This makes it far less noticeable in most. But the catch is that your hair may grow back.</p>
