<p><strong>Which Of The Following Enzymes Converts Atp To Camp</strong>. Hexokinase that converts ATP and glucose to glucose-6-phosphate and ADP. AC Converts ATP to cAMP Cyclic AMP. An ATP-powered pump that transports a specific solute can indirectly drive the active transport of another solute in a mechanism called cotransport. Conversion of ATP to cAMP is a phosphorylation reaction. This is the first committed step of the metabolic pathway of glycolysis and thus it is very tightly regulated.</p>

<p>Galactoside permease b-galactosidase ATP synthase Adenylyl cyclase. This is the first committed step of the metabolic pathway of glycolysis and thus it is very tightly regulated. This is an enzyme that works to convert both a phosphate molecule and ADP together to make ATP. AC Converts ATP to cAMP Cyclic AMP. Hexokinase that converts ATP and glucose to glucose-6-phosphate and ADP. Increases in concentration of the second messenger cAMP may lead to the activation of cyclic nucleotide-gated ion channels.</p>
<h3 id="d-adenylyl-cyclase-is-the-enzyme-the-converts-atp-to-camp">D Adenylyl cyclase is the enzyme the converts ATP to cAMP.</h3>
<p>Phospholipase C converts ATP to cAMP. Conversion of ATP to cAMP is a phosphorylation reaction. CAMP is a derivative of adenosine triphosphate ATP and used for intracellular signal transduction in many different organisms conveying the cAMP-dependent pathway. Galactoside permease b-galactosidase ATP synthase Adenylyl cyclase. D Adenylyl cyclase is the enzyme the converts ATP to cAMP. Adenylyl cyclase converts ATP to cAMP which helps CAP bind and facilitates binding of RNA polymerase to the lac promoter.</p>
