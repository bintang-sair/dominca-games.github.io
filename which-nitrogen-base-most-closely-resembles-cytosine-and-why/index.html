<p><strong>Which Nitrogen Base Most Closely Resembles Cytosine And Why</strong>. Which nitrogen base most closely resembles cytosine and why. Which nitrogen base most closely resembles cytosine and why. The four bases in DNA are adenine A cytosine C guanine G and thymine T. These bases form specific pairs A with T and G with C. Purine always pairs with pyrimidine because the space between two.</p>

<p>This pairing pattern is also known as Watson-Crick base pairing. Resembles a twisted ladder. Although there are many nitrogenous bases the five most important to know are the bases found in DNA and RNA which are also used as energy carriers in biochemical reactions. Adenine A guanine G uracil U and cytosine C. DNA is made of chemical building blocks called nucleotides. According to the materials you are using how does each type of nitrogenous base differ from the others.</p>

<p>Two nitrogen-containing bases or nucleotides that pair together to form the structure of DNA. Which nitrogen base most closely resembles cytosine and why. Purine always pairs with pyrimidine because the space between two. The points on the nitrogen bases triangles sticking out of the end that bonds with the complementary base represent the hydrogen bonds. The nitrogenous bases in RNA are the same with one exception.
