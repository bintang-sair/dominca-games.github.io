<p><strong>Which Is The Graph Of 4x 3y 12</strong>. Draw the graph of linear equation 4x 3y 12. Often two convenient points to evaluate for a linear equation are the x and y intercepts. The y intercept occurs when x 0 y 0 3 y 3 the x intercept occurs when y 0 x 3 0 x -3. 3 y 4 x 12 3 y 4 x - 12. Monthly Subscription 799 USD per month until cancelled.</p>

<p>Find the intercepts as follows. 03 and -30 should look like this. Tap for more steps. Divide each term by and simplify. 3y 12 4x. Next you would find the x-intercept and pretend y 0.</p>
<h3 id="subtract-4-x-4-x-from-both-sides-of-the-inequality">Subtract 4 x 4 x from both sides of the inequality.</h3>
<p>Draw the graph of the equation 4x - 3y 12 0. According to the graph the equation 4x 3y 12 cuts the x-axis at the point 3 0 Upvote 1. 3 y 12 4 x - 3 y 12 - 4 x. 4x 12 3y 4 x - 12 3 y. Subtract 2 x 2 x from both sides of the equation. 4x 3y 12 -4x -4x &mdash;&ndash; 3y 12 - 4x We swap the terms on the right because the form y mx b has the x term first 3y -4x 12 We divide all three numbers by 3 y x Simplify y x 4 Next we compare that to y mx b which has.</p>
