Because we take lots of long trips 5 hours each way with a packed car kids in college I think we should go ahead and look at getting a new Pilot. The 2016 Pilot earns a cool 127 complaints. 36k unknown driver not a great one given the state of the interior and exterior of the car and apparent collision damage. We have a 2007 Honda Pilot with 230000 miles. Some manufacturers build their tires to last up to 80000 miles while some design their tires to last as little as 30000 miles.</p>
<h3 id="just-be-sure-to-change-the-oil-at-manufacturer-recommended-intervals">Just be sure to change the oil at manufacturer recommended intervals.</h3>
<p>Your tires should last 50000 to 60000 miles on average. Just be sure to change the oil at manufacturer recommended intervals. Every new Honda rolls off the lot with a 3-year36000-mile limited warranty which includes the standard 12-volt battery. On average Honda Pilot owners have had to pay over 3000 to fix their transmission issues when they do crop up. But that really depends on the manufacturer. Many users have reported getting well over 300000 miles with very few serious problems or parts requiring replacement.</p>
