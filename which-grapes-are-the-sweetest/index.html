    "description": "These green grapes were named after William Thompson the first person to popularize this variety in America. Like the modern-day Lebanese the fearless seafaring Phoenicians had an urge to meet distant horizons with zeal and brought grape growing. Apricot peach and honey are common. Domestic black grapes are available in June and July while Black Beauties from Chile are available in mid-winter. The Phoenicians are credited with many things but delivering the gift of wine to the shores of southern Europe is something for which mankind will always be thankful.",
