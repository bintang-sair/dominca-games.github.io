<p><strong>Which Metabolic Pathway Is Common To Cellular Respiration And Fermentation</strong>. What is the common metabolic pathway of these three nutrients. The final electron acceptor of the electron transport chain that functions in oxidative phosphorylation is 59. Glycolysis is a metabolic pathway common to both fermentation and cellular respiration of a glucose molecule. Under anaerobic conditions the absence of oxygen pyruvic acid can be routed by the organism into one of three pathways. So the correct answer is Glycolysis.</p>
