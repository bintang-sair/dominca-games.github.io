<p>When it comes to how long to charge a motorcycle battery it will vary from one battery type to another. So a 45 Ah car battery should be charged at somewhere near 45 A and a 14 Ah motorcycle battery at around 14 A. If the reading is between 1206V and 1263V it means that your battery needs to be charged longer. The basic rule in battery charging is to not charge a battery for more amp hours than the battery is rated to have. So a person who has a twelve amp battery would use a two amp charger on their battery for no longer than six hours. Therefore before placing the battery in the motorcycle it is best to charge the battery for a couple of hours.</p>
