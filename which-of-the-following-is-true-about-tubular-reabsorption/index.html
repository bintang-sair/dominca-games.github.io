<p><strong>Which Of The Following Is True About Tubular Reabsorption</strong>. Tubular reabsorption A returns 99 of the water filtered from the glomerulus to the blood. It is the only site of glucose reabsorption in the nephron and it reabsorbs 100 of glucose unless the person has diabetes mellitus. A it always happens via the paracellular route. The distal convoluted tubule is more permeable to water. A includes substances such as creatinine B by active mechanisms usually involves movement against an electrical andor chemical gradient C by passive processes requires ATP to move solutes from the interior of the tubule to the blood D is a way for the body to get rid of unwanted waste.</p>

<p>Tubular reabsorption A returns 99 of the water filtered from the glomerulus to the blood. APositive ions are reabsorbed by active transport. It involves the movement of substances from the tubular fluid into the peritubular capillaries. B occurs mostly in the distal convoluted tubule. Most tubular reabsorption occurs in the _____ where microvilli and their numerous carrier proteins increase the surface area available for reabsorption. What is this condition known as.</p>
