<p><strong>Which Has The Longest Wavelength</strong>. This type of electromagnetic wave has the most energy and therefore can be very dangerous. Which colour of the light has the longest wavelength. RedAs the full spectrum of visible light travels through a prism the wavelengths separate into the colors of the rainbow because each color is a different wavelength. If you are looking at the ground of a car you will notice that it is blue or green based on its motion. Violet has the shortest wavelength at around 380 nanometers and red has the longest wavelength at around 700 nanometers.</p>

<p>A wave with a large wavelength will have a _____ frequency and _____ energy. RedRed has the longest wavelength and violet has the shortest wavelength. Violet has the shortest wavelength at around 380 nanometers and red. This type of electromagnetic wave has the most energy and therefore can be very dangerous. Which has the longest wavelength. Gamma rays X-rays ultraviolet radiation visible light infrared radiation and radio waves.</p>
<h3 id="and-for-part-a">And for part A.</h3>
<p>Which Colour Of The Light Has The Longest Wavelength 1 Red 2 Blue 3 Green 4 Violet. Conversely the color with the shortest wavelength is violet at 400 nanometers. RedRed has the longest wavelength and violet has the shortest wavelength. Red light has the lowest frequencies and longest wavelengths while violet has the highest frequencies and shortest wavelengths. For part a infrared rays are the closest to radio waves which means they have the longest of wave wings. Violet has the shortest wavelength at around 380 nanometers and red.</p>
