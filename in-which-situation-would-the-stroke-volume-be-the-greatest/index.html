<p>An increased in afterload will have a negative effect on cardiac muscle shortening and stroke volume. In which of the following situations would the end-systolic volume ESV be the greatest. It is directly determined by heart rate and stroke volume as the calculation for cardiac output is an individuals heart rate x their stroke volume or HRxSV. When this situation occurs the volume remaining in the ventricle after systole the end-systolic volume will be reduced. There is a major difference in cardiac output between trained and untrained individuals performing endurance activities. Which of the following has the greatest influence on cardiac output a Heart rate.</p>
<h3 id="effects-of-increased-afterload">Effects of Increased afterload.</h3>
