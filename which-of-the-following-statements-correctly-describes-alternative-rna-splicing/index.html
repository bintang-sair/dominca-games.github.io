<p>Which of the following process correctly describes amative RNA spling Alisa mechanism for increasing the rate of translation B It can allow the production of protes of different ses and from an Clean allow the production of similar proteins from different RNA Dit increases the male of transcription RNA 5 be related to which of the. D It can allow the production of similar proteins from different RNAs. Splicing of hnRNA to make mRNA The first transcript of RNA from a eukaryotic gene is not yet ready for transcription. A eukaryotic transcription unit that is 8000 nucleotides long may use 1200 nucleotides to make a protein consisting of approximately 400 amino acids. It allows the production of similar proteins from different RNAs. Eukaryotic gene and protein sequences are precisely colinear.</p>
<h3 id="which-of-the-following-would-not-be-found-in-a-bacterial-cell">Which of the following would not be found in a bacterial cell.</h3>
<p>Which enzyme synthesizes tRNA. Eukaryotic gene and protein sequences are precisely colinear. Describes how the same gene from different organisms can be spliced. It is called hnRNA for high-molecular-weight nuclear RNA. Allows one gene to code for more than one protein. RNA pol I and III transcribe functional RNAs such as rRNAs and tRNAs.</p>
