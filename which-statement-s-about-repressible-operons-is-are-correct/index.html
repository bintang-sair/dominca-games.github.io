<p><strong>Which Statement S About Repressible Operons Is Are Correct</strong>. The trp operon is regulated by the trp repressor. It would be wasteful to produce enzymes when no lactose is available or if a preferable energy source such as glucose were available. The correct answer is a ribosome bound to the rough endoplasmic reticulum. If the statement is FALSE either correct the statement or give a counterexample. A repressible operon is on unless a corepressor is present.</p>

<p>Discovered in 1953 by Jacques Monod and colleagues the trp operon in E. The first operon codes for various products including a special T7 RNA polymerase which can bind to and transcribe the second operon. Its expressed only when lactose is present and glucose is absent. Trp E trp D trp C trp B and trp A which encodes tryptophan. The trp operon is expressed turned on when tryptophan levels are low and repressed turned off when they are high. Which statements about repressible operons isare correct.</p>
<h3 id="operons-can-not-be">Operons can not be.</h3>
<p>A repressible operon is on unless a corepressor is present. Protein-encoding primary transcript s the RNA molecules directly synthesized by RNA polymerase must undergo several processing steps to protect these RNA molecules from degradation during the time they are transferred from the nucleus to the cytoplasm and translated into a protein. Select all that apply. Repressible operons usually contain genes that code for anabolic enzymes. A repressible operon is on unless a corepressor is present. Its expressed only when lactose is present and glucose is absent.</p>
