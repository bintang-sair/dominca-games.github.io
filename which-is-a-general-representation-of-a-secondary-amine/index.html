<p><strong>Which Is A General Representation Of A Secondary Amine</strong>. What is the physical state of most amides. Hence it is secondary amine. If all the three H atom of NH3 are replace by same or different alkyl group they are referred as tertiary amine. The boiling point of the secondary amine is a little lower than the corresponding primary amine with the same number of carbon atoms. Amines are organic derivatives of ammonia NH3 in which one or more of the three Hs is replaced by a carbon group.</p>

<p>Amines are organic compound obtained from ammonia by replacement of one or more hydrogen atoms by organic groups. Important representatives include dimethylamine while an example of an aromatic amine would be diphenylamine. RRN R 3 Amine RHN H 1 Amine RHN R 2 Amine HHN H Ammonia. Amines are organic derivatives of ammonia in which one two or all three of the hydrogens of ammonia are replaced by organic groups. Hence it is secondary amine. Select the IUPAC name for the compound below.</p>

<p>Secondary amines still form hydrogen bonds but having the nitrogen atom in the middle of the chain rather than at the end makes the permanent dipole on the molecule slightly less. If all the three H atom of NH3 are replace by same or different alkyl group they are referred as tertiary amine. A primary 1 amine has one alkyl or aryl group on the nitrogen atom a secondary 2 amine has two and a tertiary 3 amine has three Figure 51 The Structure of Amines Compared to Water an Alcohol and an Ether. Amines are organic compound obtained from ammonia by replacement of one or more hydrogen atoms by organic groups. Important representatives include dimethylamine while an example of an aromatic amine would be diphenylamine. Main Difference Primary vs Secondary vs Tertiary Amines.</p>
