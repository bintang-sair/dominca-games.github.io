<p>It might take about 20 to 45 minutes to have the new tires mounted but this might vary from one shop to another. Buying Tires at Costco If I get there when they first open it still takes at least 50-60 minutes for a rotate and balance.

For example this means that they should be changed every four years if you average 5000 miles per year. However these days it takes much longer as one needs to worry about cleaning hubs the inner mounting flange of the car wheel or think about the TPMS Tire Pressure Monitoring System sensor.</p>
