<p>Two AB and Ab Coat color in mice can be agouti albino or black and is controlled by two genes that assort independently. The two genes assort. One a - 1 aaBB D. Agenes If a cell has 12 chromosomes how many chromosomes will each of the new cells have after mitosis. A phenotype ratio of 9331 in the offspring of a mating of two organisms heterozygous for two traits is expected when the gene pairs assort independently during meiosis. Linked genes are located on different chromosomes.</p>
