<p>A competitive inhibitor reduces Vmax. This means that the affinity between enzyme and substrate is not altered in noncompetitive inhibition. Binds to an enzym 0049. In allosteric regulation effector inhibitor or activator binds to a site other than the active site to bring about conformational changes and thereby affecting the activity of the enzyme. Biology questions and answers. Which of the following graphs shows the results of reaction rate vs substrate concentration for an allosteric enzyme in the absence and presence of an allosteric inhibitor.</p>
<h3 id="a-competitive-inhibitor-reduces-vmax">A competitive inhibitor reduces Vmax.</h3>
<p>The enzyme substrate complex is maximal. Allosteric inhibition is the type of enzymatic regulation where the inhibitor binds to a site other than the active site. A competitive inhibitor reduces Vmax. Allosteric enzymes Enzymes with multiple subunits have quaternary structure. A high level of ATP inhibits the enzyme by decreasing its affinity for fructose 6-phosphate. This means that the affinity between enzyme and substrate is not altered in noncompetitive inhibition.</p>
