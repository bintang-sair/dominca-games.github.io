<p><strong>Which Is The Longest Wavelength</strong>. Red light has the longest wavelength and therefore the least amount of energy in the visible spectrum. What is the shortest wavelength of Brackett series. The longest wavelengths around 700 nanometers are red and the shortest wavelengths 380 nanometers are violet. Although not visible to the naked eye ultraviolet radiation falls directly below visible violet on the spectrum. Radio waves microwaves infrared optical ultraviolet X-rays and gamma-rays.</p>

<p>When all the waves are seen together they make white light. Does Red have a longer wavelength. Violet has the shortest wavelength about 400 nanometers and it usually appears on the inner arch of the rainbow. What is the longest wavelength currently being studied by scientists. Click to visit Which is the longest wavelength in. Red waves have a relatively long wavelength in the 700 nm range and violet waves are much shorter - roughly half that.</p>

<p>Why Red has the longest wavelength and violet has the shortest wavelength. Because violet waves have the shortest wavelength of the visible light spectrum they carry the most energy. Blackbody radiation from the Sun peaks in the visible part of the spectrum but is more intense in the red than in the violet making the Sun yellowish in appearance. Violet has the shortest wavelength about 400 nanometers and it usually appears on the inner arch of the rainbow. As an example at one end of the spectrum electromagnetic waves with frequencies of 10 2 Hz which corresponds to a period of 100 s and to a wavelength of about 5000 Earth radii have been detected at the Earths center 10 10 m. Gamma has the shortest wavelength because it has a higher frequency meaning more waves in a second than any other radiation which results in.</p>
