<p><strong>Which Statement Is True For A Saturated Solution</strong>. The solution has dissolved more solute than is generally possible resulting in an unstable solution. All salts are soluble in water at room temperature. Which statement about solubility product constant Ksp is false. No more solute will dissolve in the solution. A saturated solution can be quite dilute because some substances have very low solubility.</p>

<p>No more solute will dissolve in the solution. A solution of salt water with salt at the bottom. A saturated solution is more concentrated than a supersaturated solution. An unsaturated solution is a very unstable solution b. A supersaturated solution is more dilute than an unsaturated solution d. A solubility of 20g per 100g of water means 100cm 3 of solution contains 20g of solid.</p>
