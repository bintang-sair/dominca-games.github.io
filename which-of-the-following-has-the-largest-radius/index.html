<p><strong>Which Of The Following Has The Largest Radius</strong>. Which of the following atoms has the smallest radius. A Cl- F- B Cl- cr C F F- D Ne-Kr E Ne-Ar 8 Which isoelectronic series is correctly arranged in order of increasing radius. A Na b Al c N d F. Br will have the largest atomic size because Br- has one extra electron in its valence shell which due to its unbalanced negative charge will be repelled and hence the atomic radius of Br- will increase.

<p>Trends in the atomic radius showing that moving down the periodic table size increases whereas moving across the periodic table from left to right size decreases. Does Mg2 have a larger radius than Na. Therefore according to the trend Cl has a larger radius because it is lower in the table. So the correct answer is Option C. Similarly both Si and P are in the third period and Si is to left of P therefore teh radius of P is smaller than that of Si. How do ions compare in size.</p>

<p>Sulfur and also chlorine are in the shortest period for this reason they have actually the biggest atomic radii. Since sulfur is to the left of chlorine on the regular table the will have a larger atomic radius. Which one of the following atoms has the largest radius. How do ions compare in size. 1s 2s 2p 3s 3p3 d 1s2 2s2 2p 3s2 3pS Arrange the elements in increasing order of atomic radius.
