<p><strong>Which Is A Characteristic Of Condensation Polymerization</strong>. C Characteristic features of fibres are due to strong intermolecular forces like hydrogen bonding D All are correct. Hydrohalogenation reaction is defined as the reaction in which a hydrogen halide is added to an alkene to produce corresponding haloalkanes. The reaction rarely produces a product. Condensation polymerization results in the loss of a small molecule such as water. Condensation polymerization is said to occur when two monomers combine with the loss of a small molecule such as water or HCl.</p>
