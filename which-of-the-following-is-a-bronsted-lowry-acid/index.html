<p><strong>Which Of The Following Is A Bronsted Lowry Acid</strong>. Hydrochloric acid HCl donates a proton to ammonia NH 3 to form the ammonium cation NH 4 and the chloride anion Cl -. The one which releases proton H is a bronsted acid but if H 2 S hydrogen sulphide accepts a proton. HCl - The substance has a proton H and it can donate it so its a. Im concerned that the complexity of this molecule is what the authors air referring to where it is less. H 2 O b.</p>

<p>Ammonium ion dissociates to give H ions in the solution hence it is a Brønsted-Lowry acid. HNO 2 b H 2 SO 3. View the full answer. The one which releases proton H is a bronsted acid but if H 2 S hydrogen sulphide accepts a proton. Characterize EACH of the three given statements as being TRUE or FALSE and then indicate the collective true-false status of the statements using the choices. Ammonia is a Bronsted-Lowry base.</p>
<h3 id="the-one-which-releases-proton-h-is-a-bronsted-acid-but-if-h-2-s-hydrogen-sulphide-accepts-a-proton">The one which releases proton H is a bronsted acid but if H 2 S hydrogen sulphide accepts a proton.</h3>
<p>Acids release a proton or H in water. On the other hand Cl2 can donate no protons to the solvent and is not classified as an acid. It will not make many compounds. H2O is amphoteric so it can act as both a Bronsted acid or base at neutral conditions. Bases release a hydroxide ion OH- in water. Therefore H 2 S hydrogen sulphide acts as a bronsted acid but not a bronsted base.</p>
