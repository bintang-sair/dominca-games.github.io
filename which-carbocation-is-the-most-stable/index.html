<p><strong>Which Carbocation Is The Most Stable</strong>. Lets go ahead and sort some. Answer 1 of 3. Primary allyl carbocation is stabilised only by resonance effect whereas secondary and tertiary allyl carbocations are stabilised by resonance hyperconjugation and inductive effect. Within the carbocations a tertiary carbocation is more stable than a secondary one which in turn is more stable than a primary one. Which allylic carbocation is the most st.</p>

<p>But carbocation 5 is vinylic carbocation positively charged carbon is sp 2 hybridized ie. The most stable carbocation is. Tertiary carbocation are the most stable because as it contain positive charge the other carbon which surrounds itwill share the positive charge equally so that the carbon with positive charge can get the less burden as much as possible. In our example the carbocation 4 is more stable than the carbocation 3. Primary allyl carbocation is stabilised only by resonance effect whereas secondary and tertiary allyl carbocations are stabilised by resonance hyperconjugation and inductive effect. The benzyl cation has four resonance contributors.</p>
<h3 id="one-on-the-exocyclic-carbon-and-three-in-the-ring">One on the exocyclic carbon and three in the ring.</h3>
<p>One on the exocyclic carbon and three in the ring. The carbocation 1 is a saturated carbocation which is stabilized by hyperconjugation. Overall 1o has been rearranged to 3o. The most stable carbocation is t-alkyl carbocation because the order of stability of alkyl carbocation is t-alkyl s-alkyl p-alkyl CH3 carbocation. In fact they are each about as stable as an ordinary 2 alkyl carbocation. In our example the carbocation 4 is more stable than the carbocation 3.</p>
