<p>Question 11 1 pts Which of the following statements about RNA processing is TRUE. Which of the following is NOT true of RNA processing. So the correct option is Exons are excised and hydrolysed before mRNA moves out of. Which of the following is not true of RNA processing. Introns are cut out before mRNA leaves the nucleus Splicing takes place in the cytoplasm Exons are cut out before mRNA leaves the nucleus The primary transcript pre-mRNA is often much shorter than the final RNA molecule that leaves the nucleus O RNA splicing can be. RNA splicing can be catalyzed by tRNA d.</p>
<h3 id="b-ribozymes-may-function-in-rna-splicing">B Ribozymes may function in RNA splicing.</h3>
<p>D A primary transcript is often much shorter than the final RNA molecule that leaves the nucleus. Enables batch processing which greatly speeds up high processing applications. If the option is true of some tRNAs include it in your answer. Which of the following statements is true about protein synthesis in prokaryotes. Spliceosomes are present in organelles and nuclei B. RNA splicing can be catalyzed by spliceosomes.</p>
