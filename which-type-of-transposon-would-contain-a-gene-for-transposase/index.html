<p><strong>Which Type Of Transposon Would Contain A Gene For Transposase</strong>. The PiggyBac PB transposon is a mobile genetic element that efficiently transposes between vectors and chromosomes via a cut and paste mechanism. Gene References Into Functions. Transposon Element Function Transposase Inverted Repeats. In contrast transposition involves recombination between unrelated sequences namely the ends of the transposon and a site in the target sequence. The PiggyBac transposon system is introduced into ES cells by coelectroporation of two circular plasmids.</p>

<p>Consider your own body as an example. The key difference between composite transposons and IS elements is that composite transposons are a type of transposons that carry accessory genes such as antibiotic resistance genes while IS elements or Insertion Sequence elements are transposable elements that carry only genes that code transposase that catalyze the transposition activity. The Mu transposition reaction has been modified into an in vitro reaction catalyzed by a single enzyme - MuA. For example IS1 has two genes which code for the proteins InsA and InsB which are needed for its transposition. This is flanked on both sides by short repeated DNA segments. The transposition activity of the composite transposons is highly regulated and this is the main characteristic of the Tn5 composite transposons.</p>
