<p>The geosphere consists of the core mantle and crust of the Earth. A Geosphere B Hydrosphere C Atmosphere D Biosphere. The biosphere serves as an interface between the spheres enabling water to move between the lithosphere hydrosphere and atmosphere. The biosphere acts as an interface between the spheres allowing water to move between the lithosphere hydrosphere and atmosphere. The hydrologic cycle traces the movement of water. Common examples are reflection of light as shown in figure 2-1 as well as reflection of.</p>
