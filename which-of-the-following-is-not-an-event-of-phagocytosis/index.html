<p><strong>Which Of The Following Is Not An Event Of Phagocytosis</strong>. The first step also involves chemotaxis. Phagocytosis is a major mechanism for detecting and removing potentially pathogenic material. Lastly is phagocytosis where the cell or the phagocyte engulfs a solid particle to form an internal vesicle known as phagosome. A solute concentration is higher inside the cell than outside. In a direction opposite to the one in which diffusion moves them.</p>
