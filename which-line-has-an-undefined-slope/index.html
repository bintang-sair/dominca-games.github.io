<p><strong>Which Line Has An Undefined Slope</strong>. If the slope of a line is undefined then the line is a vertical line so it cannot be written in slope-intercept form but it can be written in the form. A line with an undefined slope is by definition a vertical line. Due to this fact for every worth of y the worth for x would be the identical. The equation of the line is. A horizontal line has slope zero since it does not rise vertically ie.</p>

<p>If the slope of the line is undefined then by definition the line is a vertical line. For the line in the middle the points are 1 3 and 1 9 Let x 1 1 y 1 9 and x 2 1 and y 2 3 m y 1 y 2x 1 x 2 m 9 31 1 m 60 Since there exist no number you can multiply 0 by to get 6 we say that the slope is undefined. The undefined slope is the slope of the vertical line. Since division by 0 is undefined the slope of the line is undefinedThe equation of a line with undefined slope will look like x something. A horizontal line has slope zero since it does not rise vertically ie. If a line is vertical then its slope is undefined.</p>
<h3 id="a-vertical-line-has-an-undefined-slope-and-a-horizontal-line---has-a-slope-of-0">A vertical line has an undefined slope and a horizontal line - has a slope of 0.</h3>
<p>So a diagonal line to the right would have a positive slope. X 1 x 2. The slope of a vertical line. Why do vertical lines have undefined slope. The slope of a line can be positive negative zero or undefined. If the slope of a line is undefined then the line is a vertical line so it cannot be written in slope-intercept form but it can be written in the form.</p>
