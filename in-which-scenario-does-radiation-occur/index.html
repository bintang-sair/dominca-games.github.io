Warming soup on a stove O drying towels at the beach o cooking eggs in boiling water O warming a sore muscle with a hot pack. Radiation from diagnostic imaging modalities such as computed tomography mammography and. In fact radiation occurs most effectively in a vacuum. Radiation is emitted across the entire electromagnetic spectrum and most of the radiation emitted is in the visible part of the spectrum. On a rainycloudy day direct beam radiation is ______ and diffuse radiation is _______.</p>
<h3 id="answer-1-of-2">Answer 1 of 2.</h3>
<p>It occurs through three distinct processes. Radiation safety is a concern for patients physicians and staff in many departments including radiology interventional cardiology and surgery. The Suns rays heat Earths surface. Radiation the emission of energy as electromagnetic waves or as moving subatomic particles especially high-energy particles that cause ionization Subatomic particle radiation occurs as nuclei transition from a higher to lower energy state. According to the article why are children more susceptible to radiation than adults. From the options given the scenario whereby a radiation takes place is when drying towels on the beach.</p>
