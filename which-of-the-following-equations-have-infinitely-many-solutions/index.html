<p><strong>Which Of The Following Equations Have Infinitely Many Solutions</strong>. Then It has no solution because we get the solution at the the intersection point of the two lines but parallel lines do not intersect each otherSo it does not have infinite many solution. On the other hand if k 2 then the last row results in 0 0 giving infinitely many solutions. For this value the pair of linear equations has infinitely many solutions. Question 3 For what values of a and b will the following pair of linear equations have infinitely many solutions. Find the values of a and b for which the following system of equations has infinitely many solutions.</p>

<p>Find the values of a and b for which the following system of equations has infinitely many solutions. Looking at what values will produce a row of zeros in rows 2 or 3 we see that k 1 results in the equation 0 10 giving no solutions. A 1 a 2 are the coefficients of x. For a pair of linear equations to have infinitely many solutions. 3a 3 6 and 9 1 2b. Gives 3k k 2 3k ie 6k k 2 which means k 0 or k 6.</p>
<h3 id="c-1-c-2-are-the-constants">C 1 c 2 are the constants.</h3>
<p>It means equation 37x-3737x-37 has infinite many solutions. Given pair of equations are. C 1 k 5. Thus for example if we find two distinct solutions for a system then it follows from the theorem that there are infinitely many solutions for the system. Kx 3y 2k 1 2k 1x 9y 7k 1 asked Apr 27 in Linear Equations by Gargi01 506k points. A 2 4.</p>
