    "description": "Even after an entire adult cockroach population has been killed the cockroach eggs can still hatch as little as 36 days later and the homeowners nightmare is far from over 1. The hatching stage can take more than 3 months. It takes cockroaches about one to two months to hatch though the egg stage can last from 14. You can expect each female German roach to produce an egg capsule around every six weeks. Female cockroaches have longer lives than males with some living almost two years.",
