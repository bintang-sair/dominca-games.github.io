<p><strong>Which Blood Vessels Carry Impure Blood</strong>. The pure or oxygenated blood is transported from the lungs to the other parts of the body by the arteries or the arterioles and the impure or deoxygenated blood from the body to the lungs is carried by the veins or the venules. Veins carry impure venous blood back from other parts of the body to the right side of the heart. All the arteries carry pure blood except the pulmonary artery which carries impure blood. These carry impure deoxygenated blood from body organs to the heart. The blood vessel which carry impure blood ie blood rich in carbon dioxide to lungs is.</p>

<p>The blood vessels that carry blood from various parts of the body and organs are called veins. To carry oxygenated blood from right ventricles to the lung for purification. Arteries are deeply situated in the body. Despite carrying oxygenated blood this great vessel is still considered a vein because it carries blood towards the heart. The impure blood enters the heart from two large veins called the superior and inferior vena cava. Blood flows with a high pressure and speed.</p>
