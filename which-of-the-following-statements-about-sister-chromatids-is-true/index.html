<p>Which statement about sister chromatids is true. So the correct answer is Non-sister chromatids within a tetrad exchange genetic material Solve any question of Cell Cycle And Cell Division with- Patterns of problems. They code for the same genes and have virtually identical information. Sister chromatids are identical copies of each other produced during DNA replication. Pairing up of chromosomes during meiosis II creates new arrangements of genes within a single chromosome c. One comes from the mother and the other comes from the father.</p>
