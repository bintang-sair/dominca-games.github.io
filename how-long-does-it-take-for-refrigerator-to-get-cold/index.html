    "description": "Mini fridges are ready quicker with an average cooling time of 4 hours. Simply place the thermometer into the glass of water then put it in the middle of your fridge and wait for the temperature to reach 38-40 degrees Fahrenheit. This time then keeps on increasing along with the appliances size and its working capability. Some small and powerful refrigerators can be effectively cold within a few hours. This is why if your fridge does not measure temperature on its own you need to check it yourself.",
