Caesium is the most reactive metal in the periodic table so much that working with this metal often ends in explosions. The most reactive element is fluorine the first element in the halogen group. Fluorine is the most reactive nonmetal because it is the most electronegative nonmetal in the periodic table. Fluorine is identified as the most reactive nonmetal and the most electronegative element in the periodic table making it the strongest oxidizing agent.",

<p><strong>Which Element Is The Most Reactive Nonmetal</strong>. The trend in reactivity in the nonmetals is the opposite of the trend in the metals. The period 2 element would be more reactive because the attractive force of protons is stronger when electrons are attracted to a closer electron shell. Which element in Period 2 of the Periodic Table is the most reactive nonmetal. Fluorine is identified as the most reactive nonmetal and the most electronegative element in the periodic table making it the strongest oxidizing agent. S-block elements have one or two electron in their outmost e shells hence they become stable by giving up one electron easily low ionization energy to become.</p>

<p>Fluorine is identified as the most reactive nonmetal and the most electronegative element in the periodic table making it the strongest oxidizing agent. It is also the most reactive group of all chemical elements. The most reactive nonmetal is fluorine F. Which element in Period 2 of the periodic table is the most reactive nonmetal. Which block element is highly reactive. Since reactivity of nonmetals increases going up the periodic table oxygen is therefore the most reactive nonmetal in the group.</p>
<h3 id="which-element-has-the-highest-reactivity">Which element has the highest reactivity.</h3>
<p>In the metals reactivity increases down a group and to the right. Due to its strong electro negativity small size Fluorine has a strong tendency to accept electrons from other atoms or ions. Francium is the most reactive metal. Halogens are highly reactive because they are all electronegative. Florine group 17 most reactive Which element in Period 4 is classified as an active metal. Since reactivity of nonmetals increases going up the periodic table oxygen is therefore the most reactive nonmetal in the group.</p>
