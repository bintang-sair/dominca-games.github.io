Insect-specific viruses are as the name reveals characterised by their incapacity to infect vertebrates. The discovery of 214 novel vertebrate-associated RNA viruses will likely help us to understand the diversity and evolution of RNA viruses in vertebrates. The genes encoding one of the viral proteins called the Rep protein appear to be hybrids and share significant sequence similarity.

<p>One difference between rabies and the influenza A virus is that the rabies virus is a part of the Rhabdoviridae family and the influenza A virus is a part of. The 2 subfamilies are called Chordopoxvirinae which infect vertebrates and are closely related antigenically and Entomopoxvirinae which infect arthropods. Average annual precipitation and are the two major features that define the biomes on earth. Influenza viruses have a segmented genome. There are two sub families - Coronavirinae Coronaviruses which infect mammals and birds and the Torovirinae Toroviruses figure 2 which infect vertebrates especially cattle pigs and horses.
