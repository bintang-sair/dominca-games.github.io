<p><strong>Which Of The Following Bonds Would Be The Most Polar</strong>. So when were looking at the most polar we want the biggest difference in electro negativity which is also known as doubts a try and that drawing. The H-CI bond can be represented as B. Cl - I bond is less polar than Cl-Br bond. A unique platform where students can interact with teachersexpertsstudents to get solutions to their queries. The higher the electronegativity difference the more polar a bond is.</p>

<p>Thus N-Cl and N-N bonds are almost non-polar. The quick answer right from the get-go since nitrogen is one of the most electronegative elements in the periodic table the bond it forms with hydrogen will be the most polar out of all those listed. The molecule with the polar bond that has the greatest difference in electronegativity is the most polar. However I would reckon the bond would be highly polar covalent and probably undergo hydrolysis in. Which of the following bonds will be most polar. A covalent bond is formed by the sharing of electrons by two non-metals.</p>
