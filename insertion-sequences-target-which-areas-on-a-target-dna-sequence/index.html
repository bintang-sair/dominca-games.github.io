<p><strong>Insertion Sequences Target Which Areas On A Target Dna Sequence</strong>. Consensus sequence and DNA bending at the target site Hallet Bernard. Primer pairs used for junction PCR are indicated as black arrows and primers used to detect unmodified target DNA are indicated as blue arrows. Insertion sequences are part of transposons sequences of DNA that can move around to different positions within the genome of a single cell in a process called transposition which use insertion sequences to insert into another or another part of the genome. Insertion sequences can represent a severe threat to genome instability as their insertion. IS1 IS2 IS3 IS10 IS50 IS911 IS26 etc.</p>

Consensus sequence and DNA bending at the target site Hallet Bernard. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. Another general feature of IS elements is that on insertion most generate short directly repeated sequences DRs of the target DNA flanking the IS. This is not the only naming scheme used however. Although insertion sequences are usually discussed in the context of prokaryotic genomes certain eukaryotic DNA sequences belonging to the family of Tc1 mariner transposable.</p>

<p>A gene coding for antibiotic resistance A sequence of nucleotides identical to the inverted repeat sequence found on the insertion sequence itself A unique inverted repeat sequence not found on the insertion sequence The gene that codes for transposase. In addition the fact that several donor DNA sequences which favor synapsis appear to serve as hot spots for transposon insertion suggest that similar. Delcour Jean 1994-10-01 000000 Summary In its natural host Bacillus thuringiensis the insertion sequence IS231A is preferentially inserted. Brunaud et al 2002 and several T-DNA insertion sites Forsbach et al 2003. Transposons will carry other genes with them eg genes for antibiotic resistance. Insertion sequences can represent a severe threat to genome instability as their insertion.</p>
