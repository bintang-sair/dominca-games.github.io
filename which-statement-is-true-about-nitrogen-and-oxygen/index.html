    "description": "The second ionisation energy of oxygen is greater than that of nitrogen. Air is all around us however we cant watch it. This is due to excess carbon dioxide that may be accumulating in the room. Three intermolecular forces are hydrogen bonds dipole-dipole bonds and London dispersion forces. Therefore their impact on weather and climate can be ignored.",

<p>Air isnt simply gas. Two water molecules interact due to partial charges on the oxygen and hydrogen atoms. Animals breathe in oxygen and release carbon dioxide which is used by plants. Considering factors that affect that solubility which statement below truea The solubility of a gas in any solvent is increased as the partial pressure of the gas above the solvent increasesb The solubility of gases in water increases with increasing temperaturec With few exceptions the solubility of most solid solutes in water decreases as the solution temperature. Large organic molecules are usually assembled by polymerization of a few kinds of simple subunits. The wait in Earths environment is comprised of around 78 percent nitrogen and 21 percent oxygen.</p>
