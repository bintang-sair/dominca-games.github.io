<p><strong>How Long Does A Growler Last</strong>. What is the shelf life of a growler. Of course its best to consume the beer inside as soon as possibleideally youd fill a growler the day you intend to drink it. A growler filled by a machine like they have at Victory and Sly Fox will last a long time like the 6 months that Wassailwilly alludes to in his post wrt Storm King. But keep in mind oxygen is now in the beer and its a quick decline to having a flat beer. Wilb Initiate 0 Oct 18 2011 Michigan.</p>

<p>Obviously it will vary depending on style and I wouldnt worry about a month old stout crowler. The fresh beer in a growler has a shelf life of 36 hours after opening before it becomes flat and loses taste. While how long crowlers last depends on how you care for them they remain fresher for longer than the glass alternatives. Once opened however leftover beer will be flat within 36 hours at best. Growlers of beer will stay fresh for several days some say up to 10 days if left unopened. Growlers of beer will stay fresh for several days some say up to 10 days if left unopened.</p>

<p>Our regulator cap can. How long will a growler stay fresh. If the growler is tightly sealed and remains unopened and chilled the beer stays fresh for several days even longer if the bar has a filling system that injects carbon dioxide into the growler. Once it is opened you should drink it phone a friend for larger volume growlers. Drink growlers within a couple days of filling. Growlers represent a fun way to purchase and enjoy beer but growlers are meant to be enjoyed shortly after you buy them.</p>
