    "description": "A simpler way to see some of the features of a living cell is to observe the light that is scattered by its various components. Which type of microscope shows cells against a bright background but also differentiates intracellular structures of unstained cells based on their varying densities. Understand Learning Outcome. Consequently the cell appears as a bright object against a dark background. The lens closest to the eye is called the ocular while the lens closest to the object is called the objective.",
