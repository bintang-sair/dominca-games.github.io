<p>Plants get the energy they need for photosynthesis from sunlight. In plants the process of photosynthesis takes place in the mesophyll of the leaves inside the chloroplasts. In this process six molecules of carbon dioxide and 12 molecules of water is used to form one molecule of glucose. This occurs in the presence of sunlight. The byproducts are six molecules of H2O and O2. Ad Chlorophyll Fluorescence and Photosynthesis Measured Simultaneously.</p>
