<p><strong>Which Postulate Of The Kinetic Molecular Theory</strong>. Gases are composed of very tiny particles molecules. Using the segment addition postulate which is true. The kinetic-molecular theory has several postulates. Which postulate or theorem proves that these two triangles are congruent. Asked Jun 23 2017 in Chemistry by DebiWebi.</p>

<p>The postulate from kinetic-molecular theory that the particles in a gas are in constant random motion is equally applicable to liquids except the. The molecules move randomly and their directions only changed after collision with other gas molecules of the walls of the container. Which statement describes the particles of an ideal gas based on the kinetic molecular theory. The kinetic theory of gases refers to the thermodynamic behavior of gases. These particles are so small compared to the distances between them that the volume of the individual particles can be assumed to be zero. View the full answer.</p>

<p>The Kinetic Theory of Matter is based upon the principle of atoms or more commonly molecules moving around in random motion. 2 The average kinetic energy of gases are directly proportional to the absolute temperature in. This fact explains the compressibility of gases. Kinetic Molecular Theory states that gas particles are in constant motion and exhibit perfectly elastic collisions.
