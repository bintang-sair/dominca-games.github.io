<p><strong>Which Of The Following Hereditary Diseases Involves Multiple Genetic Mutations</strong>. Distal hereditary motor neuropathies multiple types. These are called silent mutations. ALS Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis Symptoms Causes Life Expectancy. These mutations are present from the time sperm fertilizes an egg in the zygote or in the sperm or egg themselves. Mutations that an individual inherits from their parents are called hereditary mutations.</p>

<p>A mutation that change a codon specifying one amino acid to a termination codon is called a mis sense mutation b transition mutation c non-sense mutation d frameshift mutation. HSPB8 HSPB1 HSPB3 GARS REEP1 IGHMBP2 SLC5A7 DCTN1 TRPV4 SIGMAR1. Down syndrome happens when a fetus inherits an extra copy of the 21st chromosome. Chromosomes are made of a very long strand of DNA and contain many genes hundreds to thousands. The most common type of hereditary amyloidosis is transthyretin amyloidosis ATTR a condition in which the amyloid deposits are most often made up of the transthyretin protein which is made in the liver. There are two main types of Hirschsprung disease known as short-segment disease and long-segment disease defined by the region of the intestine lacking nerve cells aganglionic segments.</p>

<p>When such diseases are inherited rather than the result of a random mutation it means they are passed along to a child from one or both parents according to a specific patterns of inheritance. These are called silent mutations. But the mutations we hear about most often are the ones that cause disease. Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency AATD is an inherited disorder caused by mutations in the SERPINA1 gene. Health 09032020 1349. There are many types of hereditary amyloidosis associated with different gene mutations and abnormal proteins.</p>
