<p>However some loads will only take 20 minutes and others may require 60 minutes or more. The time each of these clothes will take to dry differs. Typically a tumble dryer can dry an average-sized load in about an hour. Sometimes I hang out clothes that I do not like to put in dryer. 2 -25 hours for a normal average load is MUCH too long. Its not that its taking longer its the heat of the flames affect the drying I think after some tests.</p>
