Then theres the forehead pattern and Byakugou is connected to Katsuyu also on the forehead so. There is also the fact that his Sage mode is black which isnt a color that other sage modes has followed. This is all that you should be aware of to understand the basics of Sage Mode. So the only reasonable explanation is that Hashirama is a slug sage who learnt sage mode at the Shikkotsu forest.",

<p>Theres a reason why where or who he learned it from has never been officially stated. He is able to heal himself without weaving sealsan ability Katsuyu his clan is also known as the Senju clan of the forest and if you look at it that may also be where he mastered wood release. Unfortunately we dont know much about Hashiramas Sage Mode technique because it was never revealed. These are the three types of Sage Mode that we saw in the series. For all we know Hashirama could be the only character who traveled to both Mount Myoboku and the Snake Cave forgot what its called and learned Sage Mode from both species and thats what allows him to have a unique Sage Mode in the first place. Minato started learning harnessing nature chakra and due to his higher intellect he even partially mastered it.</p>
