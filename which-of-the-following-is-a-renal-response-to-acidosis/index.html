<p>In short ammoniagenesis seems to be the main early response to respiratory acid-base derangements but as the renal bicarbonate reabsorption ramps up renal acid secretion decreases and in states of chronic respiratory acidosis there is no major increase in renal acid excretion beyond normal levels.</p>
