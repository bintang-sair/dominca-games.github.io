<p>In the Mountain lake in the area near the Adventurers Guild. Walleye can only be caught in Fall when its raining 12PM to 2AM. I cant even begin to tell you how hard it is to catch some.

The Mountain Lake is also the only location where you can find the Legendary Fish The Legend And Legend II.</p>
