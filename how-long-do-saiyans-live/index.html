A plausible explanation is that Saiyans do indeed need air to breathe but due to their superior cardiovascular conditioning are able to hold their breath for long periods of time but still need a source of air to retreat into after a few minutes which Goku would not have after Planet Namek had exploded.

The race are renowned for keeping themselves in peak physical condition so thats no surprise but did you know just how long a Saiyan remains in the prime of their life.

How Long Do Saiyans Live For Dragon Ball Super Goku Dragon Ball Anime Dragon Ball Super From pinterest.com</p>
<p>It was only a few years back I recently realized that Saiyans like Goku and Vegeta aged just like regular humans but slower. Super Saiyan 2 is the second form of Super Saiyan not counting the variations. It is noted to be the true power of the first Super Saiyan transformation. After they reach 100 years old their body starts to age quickly. Altho saiyans have a lifespan of 140 years most of them die young due to their tendency towards violence destruction and wars. Human beings as we know dont make it any further than 30 before they start groaning when they get out of chairs and constantly complaining that their back andor knees hurt.</p>
<h3 id="pretty-much-every-human-character-aside-from-tien-and-chiaotzu-have-visibly-aged-by-then">Pretty much every human character aside from Tien and Chiaotzu have visibly aged by then.</h3>
<p>After they reach 100 years old their body starts to age quickly. According to the Daizenshuu a Dragon Ball encyclopedia a saiyans lifespan is about the same as an average Human 70 to 90 years with exceptions of course but keep in their peak longer. This is beacause they age at half the rate of humans. There is also the possibility that Saiyans are biologically immortal not dieing from old age just like lobsters. It was only a few years back I recently realized that Saiyans like Goku and Vegeta aged just like regular humans but slower. Taking what little of the technology that interested them notably the Scouters and Battle Armor the Saiyans established their own society amidst the ruins of the Tuffle civilization crowning King Vegeta and naming the planet after him.</p>

<p>I was going to say that the average Saiyan life expectancy should be in the 80s or 90s but being a warrior race very few probably actually lived that long.</p>

<p>After this Super Saiyan gets upgraded into Full Power Super Saiyan essentially giving you Super Saiyan Grade 2 but with half the damage reduction and less energy cost.</p>
