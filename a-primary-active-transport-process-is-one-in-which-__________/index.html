<p><strong>A Primary Active Transport Process Is One In Which __________</strong>. Transport Across Plasma Membrane Primary active transport moves ions across a membrane and creates a difference in charge across that membrane. A primary active transport process is one in which __________. Molecules move through transport proteins that have been activated by ATPPrimary active transporters such as the sodium-potassium ATPase or pump are activated when ATP is. Primary active transport uses a direct source of chemical energy for example ATP in order to move the molecules across their gradient and across a membrane. A primary active transport process is one in which __________.</p>

<p>Cells rely on active transport mechanisms when molecules are moved. Primary active transport utilizes chemical energy from ATP to drive protein pumps that are embedded in the cell membrane. Secondary active transport is the transport of two different molecules across a transport membrane using energy in other forms than ATP. Active transport is the movement of molecules across cell membranes that requires energy expenditure by the cell. A primary active transport process is one in which molecules move through transport proteins that have been activated by ATP. The primary active transport system uses ATP to move a substance such as an ion into the cell and often at the same time a second substance is moved out of the cell.</p>

<p>A primary active transport process is one in which __________. As sodium ion concentrations build outside of the plasma membrane because of the primary active transport process this creates an electrochemical gradient. A primary active transport process is one in which _____. A primary active transport process is one in which __________. Examples of such substances that are carried across the cell membrane by primary active transport include metal ions are Na K Mg 2 and Ca 2. Primary active transporters such as the sodium-potassium ATPase or pump are activated when ATP is.</p>
