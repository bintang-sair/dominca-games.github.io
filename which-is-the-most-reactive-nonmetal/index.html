<p><strong>Which Is The Most Reactive Nonmetal</strong>. Fluorine is a halogen which is Group 17 on the periodic table and the halogens are the most reactive Is Potassium the most reactive metal. Since the noble gases are a special group because of their lack of reactivity the element fluorine is the most reactive nonmetal. Due to its strong electro negativity small size Fluorine has a strong tendency to accept electrons from other atoms or ions. As its capacity to tempt the shared pair of electron towards itself is more than any type of various other element fluorine is said to be the a lot of reactive nonsteel in the periodic table. Florine group 17 most reactive Which element in Period 4 is classified as an active metal.</p>

<p>Looking at metals theoretically the most reactive metal would be francium. The most reactive nonmetals are those that can most easily gain valence electrons. Which element in Period 2 of the periodic table is the most reactive nonmetal. Potassium is in the most reactive group of elements the alkali metals but its not the most reactive metal within the group. The most reactive nonmetals reside in the upper right portion of the periodic table. What element is most reactive gas.</p>

Fluorine is a halogen which is Group 17 on the periodic table and the halogens are the most reactive nonmetals. Since the noble gases are a special group because of their lack of reactivity the element fluorine is the most reactive nonmetal. The trend in reactivity in the nonmetals is the opposite of the trend in the metals. The most reactive nonmetals are those that can most easily gain valence electrons. May 20 2015.</p>
