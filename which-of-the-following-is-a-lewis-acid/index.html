<p><strong>Which Of The Following Is A Lewis Acid</strong>. One of the most applicable theories is the Lewis acidbase motif that extends the definition of an acid and base beyond H and OH- ions as described by Brønsted-Lowry acids and bases. A l 3 a q 6 H 2 O l A l H 2 O 6 3 a q B F 3 is a trigonal-planar molecule because electrons can be found in only three places in the valence shell of the boron atom. The classic example of the Lewis acid- base reaction is. Fe3 aq 6CN- aq FeCN68- aq View Available Hints O Fe3 O ON O FeCN63 Submit Part B Classify each of the following as a Lewis acid or a Lewis base. Answer 1 of 3.</p>

<p>Lewis Acid is something that accepts a pair of electrons. Thus all cations are Lewis acids since they are able to accept electrons. This has a cellular trigonal planar geometry. The following equations illustrate the general application of the Lewis concept. B C 2 H 4 Explanation. As a result the boron atom is s p 2 hybridized which leaves an empty 2 p z orbital on the boron atom.</p>
<h3 id="option-c---according-to-the-characteristics-of-being-a-lewis-acidit-can---accept-an-electron-pair">Option C - According to the characteristics of being a Lewis acidit can - Accept an electron pair.</h3>
<p>Therefore option D is the right answer. Option 1 Option 2 Option 3 NaH. Thus all cations are Lewis acids since they are able to accept electrons. A Lewis Base is something that donates a pair of electrons. Correct Answer - A A Lewis acid is characterized by its ability to accept at least one lone pair using an empty orbital of right energy. This is a crystalline solid containing hydroiodic acid and boric acid which reacts vigorously with water.</p>
