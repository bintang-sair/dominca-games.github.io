This means that covalent compounds do not dissolve in water and instead form a distinct layer on the waters surface. While the ions in an ionic compound are strongly attracted to each other covalent bonds create molecules that can separate from each other when a lower amount of energy is added to them.

<p>Properties of Covalent Compounds. Covalent compounds are generally poor conductors of electricity. They have following properties ie. Certain properties possessed by these compounds differ because of differences in the types of bonds present in these compounds. Superior malleability is not a property of covalent compounds. Covalent compounds tend to be more flammable than ionic compounds.</p>
