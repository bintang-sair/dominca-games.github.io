<p><strong>During Proofreading Which Of The Following Enzymes Reads The Dna</strong>. DNA polymerases are the enzymes that build DNA in cells. Which molecule serves to destabilize the DNA helix in order to open it up creating a replication fork. During DNA replication an enzyme called DNA polymerase proofreads the genetic code of DNA. This process is called proofreading. During proofreading which of the following enzymes reads the DNA.</p>

<p>Which enzyme acts as a proofreader during DNA replication. DNA helicase enzyme functions Unwinds DNA. During DNA replication an enzyme called DNA polymerase proofreads the genetic code of DNA. Which of the following enzymes has proofreading activity. Immediately after DNA synthesis any remaining mispaired bases can be detected and replaced in a process called mismatch repair. The helicase enzyme breaks the hydrogen bond while topioisomerase breaks the phosphate backbone in order to give rise to a replication fork where new DNA strand are synthesized.</p>

<p>Deoxyribozymes also called DNA enzymes DNAzymes or catalytic DNA are DNA oligonucleotides that are capable of performing a specific chemical reaction often but not always catalytic. Question 11 During proofreading which of the following enzymes reads the DNA. During DNA replication copying most DNA polymerases can check their work with each base that. Primase are primary enzymes which help in DNA replication process. Can DNA function as an enzyme. What type of enzyme activity is required for DNA polymerase proofreading.</p>
