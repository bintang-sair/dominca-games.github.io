<p><strong>Which Energy Carrier Directly Supplies The Calvin Cycle</strong>. Also known as the citric acid cycle the Krebs cycle is a chain of reactions occurring in the mitochondria through which almost all living cells produce energy in aerobic respiration. Figure 2 illustrates the basic processes of the Calvin cycle. Cytochrome C carries the electrons to the final protein complex protein complex 4. This carbon-fixation cycle also called the Calvin cycle is outlined in Figure 14-39. Nevertheless the Calvin cycle in most plants occurs during daylight because that is when the light reactions can provide the NADPH and ATP the Calvin cycle requires.</p>

<p>Figure 2 illustrates the basic processes of the Calvin cycle. The various fates or uses of acetyl-CoA are summarized in Figure 1111 Cell Chemistry. It uses oxygen and gives out water and carbon dioxide as products. These reactions are also called the light-independent reactions because they are not directly driven by light. Although the Calvin Cycle is not directly dependent on light it is indirectly dependent on light since the necessary energy carriers ATP and NADPH are products of light-dependent reactions. In this way Calvin cycle becomes a pathway in which plants convert sunlight energy into long-term storage molecules such as sugars.</p>
