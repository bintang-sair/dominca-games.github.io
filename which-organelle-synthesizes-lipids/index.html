<p><strong>Which Organelle Synthesizes Lipids</strong>. Was this answer helpful. The Endoplasmic Reticulum is responsible for synthesizing lipids and the Golgi Complex is responsible for synthesizing. What organelle makes lipids and hormones. Steroid hormones are synthesized from cholesterol in the gonads and adrenal gland. Cells which secrete these products such as those in the testes ovaries and sebaceous glands have an abundance of smooth endoplasmic reticulum.</p>

<p>Asked Aug 17 2019 in Anatomy Physiology by attyphelan anatomy-and-physiology. The most abundant lipid which is present in the cell membrane is a phospholipid that contains a polar head group attached to two hydrophobic fatty acid tails. Specialized cells can have a lot of smooth endoplasmic reticulum and in these cells the smooth ER has many functions. Not surprisingly then the key structural feature of cells that synthesize lipids is an abundance of the SER. This organelle is located near the rough endoplasmic reticulum and it produces phospholipids and cholesterol that help stabilize the membranes of the entire cell. Was this answer helpful.</p>
<h3 id="steroid-hormones-are-synthesized-from-cholesterol-in-the-gonads-and-adrenal-gland">Steroid hormones are synthesized from cholesterol in the gonads and adrenal gland.</h3>
<p>Steroid hormones are lipid soluble allowing them to diffuse through the plasma membrane. The embedded proteins act as channels for the transfer of particles across the cell with some proteins acting as receptors for the binding of various components. The endoplasmic reticulum is an organelle that is responsible for the synthesis of lipids and the modification of proteins. Specialized cells can have a lot of smooth endoplasmic reticulum and in these cells the smooth ER has many functions. These lipids are rapidly incorporated into the lipid bilayer of the endoplasmic reticulum thus causing the endoplasmic reticulum to grow more extensive. The endoplasmic reticulum also synthesizes lipids especially phospholipids and cholesterol.</p>
