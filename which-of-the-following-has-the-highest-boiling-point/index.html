<p><strong>Which Of The Following Has The Highest Boiling Point</strong>. Straight-chain molecules have higher boiling point than the branched-chain compounds. The lowest boiling point will be the lowest im which is sucrose. Intermolecular force boiling point. Selected Jun 5 2019 by Mihika Sahu. Among hydrides of group 16 elements with the increase in molecular weight van der Waal forces increase so boiling point also increases.</p>

<p>Which of the following aqueous solution should have the highest boiling point. Asked Aug 24 2019 in Chemistry by Pipee organic-chemistry. Straight-chain molecules have higher boiling point than the branched-chain compounds. Boiling points increase as the number of carbons is increased. Of the following _____ has the highest boiling point. On the basis of bonding the compound which has highest boiling point is sodium chloride.</p>
<h3 id="hence-10mna2so4-has-highest-value-of-bonding-point">Hence 10MNa2SO4 has highest value of bonding point.</h3>
<p>2-Methyl pentane has the highest boiling point because the boiling point in alkane depends upon the chains off atoms and the molecular mass of the molecules. Think of intermolecular forces CHCl3 CH4 CH2Cl2 CH2I2 CHBr3 CHI3 Ive tried to answer this question twice and have one attempt left. HCl will have a lower boiling point than HF since F is more electronegative than Cl and possess a greater degree of hydrogen bonding. Carbon has the highest melting point at 3823 K 3550 C and Rhenium has the highest boiling point at 5870 K 5594 C. Answered by wiki 03122021. All molecules possess Van der Waals Forces.</p>
