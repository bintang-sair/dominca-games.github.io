    "description": "The shelf life of pudding can vary due to the type packaging storage method and thickening agent used so see our table for more details. After the pudding is created regardless of whether its made at home or in a hurry it will decrease in shelf life drastically to about 7 days in the refrigerator and just one day in a counter. Thus the shelf life for all the varieties is not the same. However if you check the recipes online some recommend up to 5 days of storage so extending that period by a day is an option. The pudding can be stored for up to two years in a cool dry place.",
