<p>All halogens have a tendency to take up electrons and. Oxidizing agent oxidizes other elements and reduces itself. For F 2 E o RP is minimum. Which of the following is the strongest reducing agent. F 2 is the best oxidizing agent of the periodic table. And in first part of this question we were asked to find out the substance which is the strongest reducing agent and the substance which is the strongest oxidizing agent.</p>
