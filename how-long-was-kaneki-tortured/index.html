    "description": "When the injections effects wore off he forced Kaneki to eat so his fingers and toes would regrow. Anyways Kaneki is chained to a chair and has been injected with a liquid which causes his RC cells not to react or be able to be used and form his kagune. He was tortured for 10 days enough time for his hair to turn white. How long is kaneki tortured. The fact that his clothes were changed and his tendons were being severed is a strong indication that some fucked up things happened to Kaneki that we didnt see 10 days with someone as deranged as Yamori with basically no restrictions on what he can do.",

<p><strong>How Long Was Kaneki Tortured</strong>. Ken Kaneki 金木 研 Kaneki Ken is the main protagonist of Tokyo Ghoul and Tokyo Ghoulre.

<p>This misconception probably arose because in the animefor those who only watched the anime it turned white in a few seconds. But Denji could one day assume the throne of most tortured manga hero depending on how long his manga continues. When meeting these mental constructs Kaneki enters a limbo-like state where he converses with them. This might not seem like a lot but this was relentless brutal ripping-your-body-apart-and-laughing-as-it-grows-back stuff. The scene itself isnt censored because there are a lot of more violent Anime scenes on the internet I mean Attack on Titan wasnt censored so I doubt TG will. The whole reason he latched on Kaneki was because he found how strong he was.</p>
