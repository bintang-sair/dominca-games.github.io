<p><strong>Plant Cell Walls Contain Which Of The Following In Abundance</strong>. What serves as the building blocks of nucleic acids. This happened because the criteria for classification changed. Hemicellulose is a component of plant cell walls and consists of a heterogeneous group of polysaccharides that vary both between different plants and within a plant depending on the location. Cellulose mostly comprises a plants cell wall. Fibers are long and narrow.</p>
