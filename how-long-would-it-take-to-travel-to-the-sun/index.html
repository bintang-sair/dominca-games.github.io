<p><strong>How Long Would It Take To Travel To The Sun</strong>. Earth the third planet from the Sun takes 36526 days to orbit the Sun. How long does it take a photon to go through the convection zone. It is so far away that light from the Sun traveling at a speed of 186000 miles 300000 kilometers per second takes about 8 minutes to reach us. When merging two protons in a nucleus of deuterium to create a helium nucleus photons are released. Taking these two facts into account the approximate amount of heat we would receive from the next closest star would be 0000000014 as that from the Sun an infinitesimal amount indeed.</p>

<p>Learn this topic by watching Speed of Light Concept Videos. A recent survey of scientific literacy in Australia found 30 believe it takes one day for the Earth to go around the sun. If an airplane could survive near the 5800 K photosphere of the sun its trip around the sun at 600 mph would take 452233 hours. One orbit around the sun takes about 88 Earth days How Long It traveling at a speeding of 107082 miles per hour. The short answer is that it takes sunlight an average of 8 minutes and 20 seconds to travel from the Sun to the Earth. It is so far away that light from the Sun traveling at a speed of 186000 miles 300000 kilometers per second takes about 8 minutes to reach us.</p>
