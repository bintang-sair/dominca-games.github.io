    "description": "Personally speaking on an average earphones last for around a year with medium to heavy use after which some problems start occurring in them like one side of earphone will stop working andor micif present will stop working andor if wired it will pause and start music on its own with shift in. Modern gaming headsets last anywhere between 2-5 years. For example if you have in-ear or headphones or earbuds they can easily get clogged with ear-wax which will impair their functionality. It seems like no matter what pocket I put my iPhone in the part of the headphones thats closet to the iPhone plugin part never lasts long either earphones quit working right or have even had it break off entirely. Of course there will no need for repairs if you can handle them with care.",
