<p><strong>Which Enzyme Catalyzes The Elongation Of The Leading Strand</strong>. The evolution of telomerase enzyme b. The other strand. What is the role of DNA ligase in the elongation of the lagging strand during DNA replication. DNA primase forms an RNA primer and DNA polymerase extends the DNA strand from the RNA primer. DNA polymerase is an enzyme that synthesizes leading and lagging strands during replication only in one direction.</p>

<p>Which enzyme catalyzes the elongation of a DNA strand in the 5 3 direction. DNA primase forms an RNA primer and DNA polymerase extends the DNA strand from the RNA primer. Gaps left at the 5 end of the lagging strand because of the need for a 3 onto which nucleotides can attach d. The leading strand is synthesized by adding nucleotides to the 3 end of the growing strand and the lagging strand is synthesized by adding nucleotides to the 5 end. During elongation an enzyme called DNA polymerase adds DNA nucleotides to the 3 end of the newly synthesized polynucleotide strand. The enzyme that catalyzes the joining of DNA fragments together DNA polymerase.</p>

<p>DNA polymerase enzyme catalyses the reaction of adding nucleotide to growing complementary daughter strand of DNA in the direction of 5 3 during elongation in the process of replication. Ligases are present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The no ends of a circular chromosome. To add nucleotides to the 3 end of a growing DNA strand The leading and lagging strands of DNA formed during DNA replication differ in that the leading strand is synthesized in the same direction as the movement of the replication fork and the lagging strand is synthesized in the opposite direction. Which enzyme catalyzes the elongation of a dna strand in the 5 3 direction. During replication the enzyme DNA _____ catalyzes the synthesis of a new strand of DNA by adding nucleotides in a _____ directiona.</p>
