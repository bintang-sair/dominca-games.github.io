<p><strong>Which Set Is Closed Under Subtraction</strong>. It follows that real numbers are also closed under subtraction and division. For example the whole numbers are closed under addition because if you add two whole numbers you always get another whole number - there is no way to get anything else. We can say that rational numbers are closed under addition subtraction and multiplication. You can think of a set as a bag of numbered tiles. The set of Real numbers is closed under subtraction because a b R does imply a b R.</p>

<p>A set is closed under subtraction means if you can subtract any two numbers in the set and still have a number in the set as a result. System of whole numbers is not closed under subtraction this means that the difference of any two whole numbers is not always a whole number. Often a closure property is introduced as an axiom which is then usually called the axiom of closure. The non-zero Real numbers are closed under division because every non-zero Real number has a multiplicative inverse and. For any two rational numbers say x and y the results of addition subtraction and multiplication operations give a rational number. Nowtake any 2 numbers and add them.</p>

<p>A set that is closed under an operation or collection of operations is said to satisfy a closure property. A set that is closed under an operation or collection of operations is said to satisfy a closure property. For example the whole numbers are closed under addition because if you add two whole numbers you always get another whole number - there is no way to get anything else. The non-zero Real numbers R 0 are closed under division because every non-zero Real number has a multiplicative inverse and a b a 1 b. A set of numbers is said to be closed under a certain operation if when that operation is performed on two numbers. This smallest closed set is called the closure of S with respect to these operations.</p>
