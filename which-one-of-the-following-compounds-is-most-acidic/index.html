    "description": "It is even less acidic than carbonic acid but more acidic than water. 3 has most acidic hydrogen among given compounds this is due to the strong M effect of CN group which stabilize ve charge significantly. Draw all significant resonance structures of anion 2 and identify the major contributor to the resonance hybrid. So athletic strength increase as the electron withdrawing group increase. II We can explain acidity of given compounds on the basis of stability of conjugate base More stable the conjugate base more acidic the acid and vice versa.",

<p><strong>Which One Of The Following Compounds Is Most Acidic</strong>. And we know more stable the corresponding conjugate base of the acidmore acidic the acid is. Hence it will be most stable. And also we know that phenol is more acidic than alcohols like 2-chloroethanolClCH2CH2OH because it is very tough to remove the H ion from alcoholPhenol can lose ion easily because phenoxide ion formed is stabilised to some extentThis is as the negative charge on the oxygen atom is delocalised around the ring ie having a cyclic structure in phenol helps it stay stable. 246 - trinitrophenol after the loss of a proton gives 246 -trinitrophenoxide ion which is stabilised by resonance -I effect and -M effect thus a most acidic among the given compounds. II I III IV.</p>

<p>Plus here is no one electron withdrawing group and it is a really fat group and we know that aromatic group is the most pathetic than the elevated group. Phenols are much more acidic than alcohols due to the stabilisation of phenoxide ion be resonance. It is more acidic than an alcohol but less acidic than a carboxylic acid. Nitro group is highly electron withdrawing by both conjugation as well as inductive effects. In options A b and c CI atom being electron withdrawing group produces more acidic carboxylic acid here 2 chlorobutanioic acid has CI atom very nearer to carboxyl carbon and conjugate base nearer becomes most stabl and its corresponding acid is most acidic in nature therefore 2 chlorobutaniooic acid is the most acidic in nature. Thus phenol is unable to protonate H C O 3 anion but easily protonates O H anion.</p>

<p>Which one of the following compounds has the most acidic nature. Schreibers synthesis of asteltoxin compound 1 was treated with a strong base to form anion 2. The cube shown in 500 cm. Since in Phenol negative charge formed after the removal of acidic H will be delocalized in the whole ring. And we know more stable the corresponding conjugate base of the acidmore acidic the acid is. IV II I III.</p>
