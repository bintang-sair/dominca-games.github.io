<p><strong>Which Property Would Cesium Most Likely Have</strong>. Cesiums extraordinary use is that it is utilized in the production of the most exact atomic clock. They are also used to make special optical glass as a catalyst promoter in vacuum tubes and in radiation monitoring equipment. Lithium beryllium and boron nitrogen arsenic and antimony potassium calcium and gallium cesium platinum and radon Nitrogen arsenic and antimony is the group containing elements that are most likely to have similar properties. Cesium is described by the German Institute for Strategic Metals ISE as the most electropositive of all stable elements in the periodic table and the heaviest of the stable metals. Cesium is used in atomic clocks and more recently in ion propulsion systems.</p>
