<p><strong>Which Of The Following Are Polynomials</strong>. P x c 1 1 c 2 1 x x 2 where c 1 c 2 are constants. Correct option is C The power of x must be a non-negative integer in a polynomial. F x 5 is also a polynomial function of degree n 0 f x a x 2 4 x 4 where a R It is also a polynomial function of degree n 2 or n 1 depending upon a 0 or a 0. - Please explain how to do the problem. A polynomial never has negative or fractional power.</p>

<p>Hence option C is correct. 32x 3 42x 2y 11xy 2 - y 3 17 Answer. 2Constant polynomial is a polynomial which have degree 0 Zero polynomial is a polynomial having all constants ie. The polynomial function is of the form f x a n x n a n 1 x n 1 a n 2 x n 2 a 0 where n W and a n 0 Clearly f x x 3 2 is a polynomial function. Write whether the following statements are True or False. 5x - y 2 4x 2 - 6y 2 - 15 4x 2 8xy - 12x - 3y 5 4x 2 - 6y 2 5xy - 7x 19y - 15.</p>

<p>5x is also not a polynomial since the exponents of variable in 1st term is a rational number. To have x 1 as a factor substituting x - 1 must give p -1 0. So they have the form. V 3x-3 2x-1 4x 5. F x 5 is also a polynomial function of degree n 0 f x a x 2 4 x 4 where a R It is also a polynomial function of degree n 2 or n 1 depending upon a 0 or a 0. 42 - 16 B.</p>
