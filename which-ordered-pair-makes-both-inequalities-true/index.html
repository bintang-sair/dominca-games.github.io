<p><strong>Which Ordered Pair Makes Both Inequalities True</strong>. Which ordered pair makes both inequalities true. Y 13x 3 and 3x y 2. If you get a true statement then the ordered pair is a solution to the inequality. Due to the last inequality you can eliminate the last two ordered pair. The ordered pair which makes both inequalities true is 4 0.</p>
