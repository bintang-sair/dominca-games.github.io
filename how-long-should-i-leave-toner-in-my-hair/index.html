<p>How much does it cost to tone. Toner is a sweet little product that neutralizes brassy yellow and orange tones on bleached hair. The easy answer is NO. Add a bit of a leave in hair conditioner and fill rest with waterSpray on dry shampooed hair let dry. This will allow your hair to produce those much needed natural oils and also let your hair cuticles open up fully thus enhancing the potency and effect of the toner. Toners are not created equally and have different instructions for use.</p>

Saying that though I always do what they say though about porosity filler and gold parts first that i want to tone most then apply to rest of hair with the same mix clear Sent from my SM-G900I using SalonGeek mobile app. It is usually purple-blue tinted. When applied to bleached hair it takes it to more of an ashy dusty or platinum color.</p>
