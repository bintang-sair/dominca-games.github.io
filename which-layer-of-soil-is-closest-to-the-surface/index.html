<p><strong>Which Layer Of Soil Is Closest To The Surface</strong>. Topsoil is the layer of soil closest to the surface. A HORIZON- This is the layer that we call topsoil and it is located just below the O Horizon. It is the most fertile layer of soil in which the plants are able to grow. The O layer or organic matter is closest to the soil surface. O organic matterb.</p>

<p>The top most layer of the soil which contains humus and microorganisms in addition to soil particles is called top soil. A HORIZON- This is the layer that we call topsoil and it is located just below the O Horizon. O organic matter b. The quality of top soil determines the diversity of life in the region. This is because of the fact that this layer is exposed to the accumulation of plant litter like leaves twigs and animal waste like hair feces and others. Soil is not directly important to animal life.</p>
