<p><strong>Which Lists The Steps Of Differentiation Of Neuron Development</strong>. Neural development is a continuous process where neural networks begin to form during the early embryological stages with further development and maturation occurring throughout childhood and adolescence. Neuron undergoes mitosis two identical daughter cells are produced daughter cells divide to produce stem cells neuron undergoes mitosis two daughter cells are produced one daughter cell is a stem cell one daughter cell is. QUICK ANSWER PLEASE NEED HELP. These include axon regeneration in the adult neuronal differentiation and patterning of the neural plate and neural tube in the early embryos Maden 2007. The cerebral hemispheres differentiate around the fifth week.</p>
