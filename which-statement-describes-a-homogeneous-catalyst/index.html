<p><strong>Which Statement Describes A Homogeneous Catalyst</strong>. Which statement defines activation energy. A catalyst increases the rate of the reaction by lowering the activation energy. It is completely consumed by reactants. The amount of catalyst at the end of the reaction is the same as at the beginning of the reaction. It is the difference between reactant energy and maximum energy.</p>

<p>Which statement describes a homogeneous catalyst. It is completely consumed by reactants. Some common examples which you may need for other parts of your syllabus include. It forms different products than the uncatalyzed reaction forms. Therefore molecules with less energy can also effectively take part in the reaction. It is completely consumed by reactants.</p>
<h3 id="hc-6380-kjmol-ch3oh">Hc 6380 kJmol CH3OH.</h3>
<p>It is in the same phase as the reactants. If the reaction is rapid and the catalyst recycles quickly very small amounts of catalyst often suffice. CH3OHl O2 g 6380 kJ CO2 g 2 H2Og A B C D E. Which statement describes the types of change and the chemical properties of the product and reactants. It is in the same phase as the reactants. It interacts with a reactant to form an intermediate substance which then decomposes or reacts with another reactant in one or more steps to regenerate the original catalyst and form product.</p>
