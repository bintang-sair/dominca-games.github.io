    "description": "Diesel engines apart from having a more reasonable fuel economy than gasoline engines also have a prolonged life span. They are 3 major reasons why they last so long. Its a myth that todays generation of lightweight turbocharged diesels are going to last as long as diesel engine plodders made years ago. But the average lifespan is around 8-9 years or 150000 170000 miles. By ensuring your diesel engine is well maintained you can minimize maintenance costs and make sure your diesel engine keeps going for many.",

<p><strong>How Long Do Diesel Engines Last</strong>. But give me some idea. If your diesel engine is properly maintained most mechanics say that you can expect it to run on the road for 30 years. Its normal for your cars gasoline engine to run for around 200000 miles before it needs a serious overhaul or you need a new vehicle. Once in a Mercedes-diesel taxi in Germany. The average marine diesel engine will run for more than three times that long and log an average 5000 hours under the same conditions.</p>

In general diesel engines last much longer than gasoline engines. 2012 F250- 67 Powerstroke Ultimate Lariat FX4- Tuxedo Black Bakflip F1. 12th January 2018 at 0916.

<p>Gasoline engines only run for about 1500 on average. Does anyone know how many miles Ford built this engine to last. Most engines on the road today are designed to last well over 100000 miles. A diesel engine can easily manage 500000 km and still have room to keep going and going. Taxi driver told me the engine was no good if it did not al least 1000000 one million km. Diesel engines continuously run 1000000 to 1500000 miles before major overhaul.</p>
