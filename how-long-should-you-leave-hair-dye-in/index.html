<p>In general never leave a hair dye in your hair for less than 30 minutes and more than 45 minutes due to the possible hair damage and undesired colors. High-lights are a lifting and dying process meaning the need to bleach and then dye so they take longer. If you leave it on too long you might end up with a much darker color than you want you may damage the sensitive skin around your eyes or you may have too much color sitting on your skin. I often leave dyes on overnight because it means I can put it on just before bed and I dont actually have to wait 4 hours Ive slept through it. You should leave hair dye in for 30-45 minutes. The hair dry will not do any harm to your hair if you leave it even for more than an hour as it.</p>
