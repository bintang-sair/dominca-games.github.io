<p><strong>Which Teratogenic Effect Is Seen Due To Lithium</strong>. Teratogenicity is the ability to cause defects in a developing fetus. Several important phases in human development are recognized. This group primarily consists of anti-epileptic drugs including valproic acid carbamazepine and phenytoin. Many authors have reported that lithium causes congenital defects especially of the cardiovascular system such as Ebsteins anomaly a rare cardiac defect when given to women during the first trimester of pregnancy reviewed in Briggs et al 1983. Isotretinoin an acne drug alcohol.</p>

<p>This is interesting as heart defects specifically Absteins anomaly are the most prevalent teratogenic abnormalities caused by lithium 278 279. The effect produced by a teratogenic agent depends upon the developmental stage in which the foetus is exposed to the agent. This group primarily consists of anti-epileptic drugs including valproic acid carbamazepine and phenytoin. Which drug may cause Ebstein anomaly as a teratogenic effect and is also contraindicated in breast-feeding clients. Some anti-epileptic drugs eg. A teratogenic agent is a chemical infectious agent physical condition or deficiency that on fetal exposure can alter fetal morphology or subsequent function.</p>

<p>Teratogenic drugs and birth defects Each of the following drugs or drug groups may cause birth defects in a developing fetus. Thus serum lithium levels should be monitored. Ibuprofen is a NSAID that may cause premature closure of the ductus arterioles as a teratogenic effect. The teratogenicity of folate antagonists in humans was first suggested by reports of women who were given aminopterin in the first trimester of pregnancy to induce abortion Thiersch 1952. Lithium A client is receiving antibiotics and antifungal medications for the treatment of a recurring vaginal infection. The main effects attributable to lithium are cardiac malformations and babies with increased birth weight.</p>
