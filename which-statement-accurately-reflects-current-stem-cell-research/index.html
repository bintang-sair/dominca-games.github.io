And WHEREAS The National Bioethics Advisory Commission has called for the removal of the ban on public funding of human embryo research. This research includes the study manipulation and storage of stem cells as a resource for drug discovery diagnostics regenerative medicine and manufacturing of cell-based therapies. The terms mesenchymal stem cell MSC and adipose stem cell ASC are under scrutiny over how accurately they describe the origin and stemness of the cells. A qualitative research design was used to explore and describe the perceptions and experiences of participants regarding the ethical challenges of using stem cells in a subjective and reflexive manner The aim was to gather explore analyze and extract the most meaningful perceptions of the sample using interviews.
