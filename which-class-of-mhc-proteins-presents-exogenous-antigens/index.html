<p><strong>Which Class Of Mhc Proteins Presents Exogenous Antigens</strong>. Besides what is the function of major histocompatibility complex MHC proteins quizlet. Class I MHC is presented by all nucleated cells whereas class II MHC is presented by only the antigen -presenting cells. Presentation of soluble proteins via MHC class I is TAP dependentTo test the capacity of isolated DC and macrophages to present exogenous proteins these cells were incubated with soluble ovalbumin 2 mgmL for 16 hours to allow antigen processing. Exogenous antigenic peptides that are inhaled ingested or injected like particulate antigen carriers are processed by class II or endocytic pathway and is presented by MHC II molecule. Upon encountering a pathogenic organism proteins from the pathogen can be degraded into peptide fragments by the antigen-presenting cell which then sequesters these fragments into the endosome so they can bind to MHC II proteins before being transported to.</p>

<p>Class I MHC proteins are recognized by which of the following cell types that are destined to become T cells. MHC Class I proteins are capable of presenting exogenous antigens derived from various pathogens. This is known as cross-presentation. The main function of major histocompatibility complex MHC class II molecules is to present processed antigens which are derived primarily from exogenous sources to CD4 T-lymphocytes. MHC Class II presents 14-18 amino acid peptides. Which of the following types of cells display protein fragments produced by the cancer within them.</p>
