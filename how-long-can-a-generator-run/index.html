<p>With this one you can run the propane Generac whole house generators for 2 weeks at the time of power outage. While Generac generators can run longer than 24 hours during power outages if needed its still a good idea to check on your Generac every day to make sure its running properly. However if you are using an inbuilt generator you can run the whole night and even during the day too. The longevity of the generator in terms of it running entirely depends on the brand of the generator. However most generators can run on either 20- or 30-pound tanks. The more you run the generator the more frequently it will require maintenance and the shorter its lifespan.</p>

<p>The more you run the generator the more frequently it will require maintenance and the shorter its lifespan. However if you are using an inbuilt generator you can run the whole night and even during the day too. Some generators can offer a runtime of 2 hours and there are those which can run continuously for 24-hours. Depending on the size of your generator you may be able to run it on propane for an extended period of time. On 100 gallons of a propane tank a 7kW generator offers the runtime of 66 hours while for the same a 12 kW generator will run for 36 hours. This typically averages around 2-3 weeks of non-stop power generation.</p>
