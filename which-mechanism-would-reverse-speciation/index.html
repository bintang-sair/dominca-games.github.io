<p><strong>Which Mechanism Would Reverse Speciation</strong>. DReverse speciation has led to a loss of diversity and a rapid. DThese effects are predictable and novel relative to other. The alleles heterozygosity should be higher among the hybrid toads there. The models are based on a combination of laboratory experiments and. A increased gene flow B gene pools of the two species becoming increasingly different C increased ability of females to discriminate mates D decreased production of hybrids.</p>

<p>Sexual selection can also lead to speciation. The models are based on a combination of laboratory experiments and. A increased gene flow B gene pools of the two species becoming increasingly different C increased ability of females to discriminate mates D decreased production of hybrids. Historically six small lakes in southwestern British Columbia each contained a sympatric species pair of three-spined sticklebacks Gasterosteus aculeatus. Although the precise mechanisms responsible for elevated hybridization in the lake is unknown the demise of the Enos Lake species pair follows the appearance of an exotic crayfish Pascifasticus lenisculus in the early 1990s.
