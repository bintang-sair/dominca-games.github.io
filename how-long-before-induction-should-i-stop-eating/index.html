    "description": "I didnt get an enema with my induction. After the 42nd week of pregnancy complications can arise so most birth professionals will recommend that you be induced. When she got there they asked her whens the last time she ate and she told them about 9am that morning and they said We didnt hear that because I guess youre not supposed to eat before getting inducedbut her OB told her to so she did lol She did fine though. Many women mistakenly believe the date of their induction will be the day they meet their baby. I am being induced at 8pm tonight and my Dr told me to eat at around 5 but definitely not to eat anything heavy.",
