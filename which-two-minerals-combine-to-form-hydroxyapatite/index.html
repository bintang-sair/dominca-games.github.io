<p><strong>Which Two Minerals Combine To Form Hydroxyapatite</strong>. However pH-dependent hydroxyapatite deposition on bone coll. The equation for the reaction is as follows. Asked Jul 14 2017 in Nutritional Science by TheJoker advanced-nutrition. Bone is a connective tissue largely composed of an organic protein. The biological apatites are forms of calcium hydroxyapatite which has the formula Ca 10 PO 46 OH 2.</p>

Hydroxyapatite is a naturally occurring form of the mineral calcium apatitecalcium phosphorous and oxygenthat grows in hexagonal crystals.

<p>Mathrmg of 85 phosphoric acid and 100. The mineral phase was determined as low crystalline calcium-deficient hydroxyapatite with calcium to phosphorus ratio CaP of 14. Collagen fibrils guided hydroxyapatite precipitation to form bone-mimic collagenhydroxyapatite composite containing both intrafibrillar and interfibrillar hydroxyapatites. The two minerals that combine to form hydroxyapatite are phosphorous and calcium. The apatites found in bone tooth enamel and tooth dentine have slightly different compositions and therefore have different physical and mechanical properties. In the body apatite is a mineral comprised of calcium phosphorous and fluorine.</p>
