<p>Chlorophyl b for example absorbs strongly near 450 nm and 650 nm while the phycocyanins and phycoerythrins absorb more strongly in the region from 475 to 525 nm. Current understanding is that the earliest photosynthetic organisms were aquatic bacteria some of which are still around today. Solved Which portion of the photosynthetic apparatus absorbs light. Question 4 1 point Photons from light can boost an electron to a higher energy state. Accessory pigments such as. The color of the pigment comes from the wavelengths of light reflected in other words those not absorbed.</p>
