<p><strong>In Which Way Are Vesicles Different From Vacuoles</strong>. The vesicles are moved along the microtubules in a cell by motor proteins like dynein and kinesin. Vacuoles contain enzymes that play an important role in different metabolic processes. Multiple membrane vesicles come together to form vacuoles. On the flip side the vacuole mainly made up of water. The membrane holds fluid called cell sap which is composed of water and other substances.</p>

<p>Pushes the plasma membrane against the cell wall of plant. The difference would be due to its contents and its construction. It is constantly working to regulate this balance. Vacuoles are filled with water excretory substances pigments wastes etc. Apart from water vacuoles also contains different kinds of organicinorganic molecules solid materials and enzymes. This type of vesicle is especially important in.</p>
<h3 id="the-other-is-called-a-canal-fed-vacuole">The other is called a canal-fed vacuole.</h3>
<p>A vesicle is a small membrane bound chemically neutral and temporary container used to pass its contents across organelle and cell plasma membranes. Pushes the plasma membrane against the cell wall of plant. The other is called a canal-fed vacuole. In a way theyre specialized lysosomes. In sickle cell disease malformation of red blood cells is caused by only one mistake for one amino acid in the genetic code for hemoglobin. Vacuoles are membrane bound enclosed compartments which are rich in different types of organic and inorganic Molecules including enzymes and pigments and other metabolic products.</p>

<p>Vesicles are structures present inside the cell that are either formed naturally during processes like exocytosis endocytosis or transport of materials throughout the cell or they might form artificially which are called liposomes.</p>
