<p>These ________ were the first cells observed because ________. Images were then interpreted using complex mathematics. DNAs double-helix structure is on display for the first time in this electron microscope photograph of a small bundle of DNA strands. The formation of the chromosome theory of heredity. Scientists today use more refined electron microscopes for researching DNA and its structure.
