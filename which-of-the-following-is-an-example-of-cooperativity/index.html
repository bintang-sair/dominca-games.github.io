They can modulate their effect in a more subtle way b. Which of the following is an example of cooperativity. Many enzymes have multiple binding sites or form multi-domain proteins. As a result they may bind more than one substrate and this multiplicity can affect the enzymes binding affinity for multiple substrates. Which of the following is an example of cooperativity.</p>
