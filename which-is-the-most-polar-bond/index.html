    "description": "However I would reckon the bond would be highly polar covalent and probably undergo hydrolysis in moist air. Bond polarity will increase because the electronegativity distinction between the 2 bonding atoms will increase. As dipole formation is a characteristic of bond polarity the molecules exhibiting dipoles are more precisely called Polar covalent molecules. The B F bond is most polar. So the bigger difference in election negativity between the two atoms are bonded means that the bond is more polarized.",

<p><strong>Which Is The Most Polar Bond</strong>. Bond dissociation energy of F 2 molecule is less than that of C l 2 molecule. Which of the following bonds is the most polar. The quick answer - right from the get-go since nitrogen is one of the most electronegative elements in the periodic table the bond it forms with hydrogen will be the most polar out of all those listed. In simple words a bond polarity is a scientific tool that gives us an idea about the nature of the bonds and the type of bonding they will undergo to form compounds. Which bond is more polar H Cl or Ho.</p>

<p>How do you tell which covalent bond is most polar. The B F bond is most polar. The quick answer right from the get-go since nitrogen is one of the most electronegative elements in the periodic table the bond it forms with hydrogen will be the most polar out of all those listed. Those atoms having high difference of electronegativity values are more polar as compared to those having less difference of electronegativity values. The S F bond is most polar. I guess theoretically the most polar bond would be one that was.</p>
<h3 id="the-answer-is-a">The answer is a.</h3>
<p>The answer is b N - H. I guess theoretically the most polar bond would be one that was. The greatest difference in electronegativity will correspond to the most polar bond. For example a carbon-oxygen bond is more polar than an oxygen-fluorine bond because the difference in electronegativity for oxygen and carbon is greater than the difference between fluorine and oxygen. These two atoms in BrCl would have a nonpolar covalent bond. The quick answer - right from the get-go since nitrogen is one of the most electronegative elements in the periodic table the bond it forms with hydrogen will be the most polar out of all those listed.</p>

<p>In summary its essentially impossible to give you an answer as to the most polar bond as bonding can be considered a spectrum between 100 covalent and 100 ionic.</p>
