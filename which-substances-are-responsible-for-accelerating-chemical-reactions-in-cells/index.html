<p>Which substances are responsible for accelerating chemical reactions in cells. Catalysts are used up during a chemical reaction d. DKFZ researchers led by Krammer and Karsten GÃ¼low have now discovered the key regulator that is responsible for shifting the sensitive balance from vital to harmful amounts of reactive oxygen molecules and thus accelerating the aging process. Contain the genetic information found in cells. Which substances are responsible for accelerating chemical reactions in cells. Although RNAs are capable of catalyzing some reactions most biological reactions are catalyzed by proteins.</p>

<p>Contain the genetic information found in cells. The efficiency of enzymes in accelerating chemical reactions is crucial to the maintenance of life. Mitochondrion A chemical substance composed of atoms of two or more distinct elements chemically bonded to one another is called a. They are also helpful in accelerating the speed of a chemical reaction even without being changed after it completes the reaction. Metabolism includes the breakdown of substances catabolism the formation of new products synthesis or anabolism or the transferring of energy from one substance to anotherMetabolic processes have the following characteristics in common.
