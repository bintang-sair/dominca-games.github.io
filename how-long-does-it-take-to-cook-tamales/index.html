    "description": "When steam cooking tamales cooking time will depend on how many tamales are you cooking the kind and size of the pot and if you are cooking them in an electric or gas stove as a general rule the tamales are ready when. To make tamales on the stovetop simply add the tamales to the strainer add 2 cups of water to the base of the pot cover and steam on medium heat for about 30-40 minutes or until the masa separates easily from the husks. This is my 40 Qt pot that I use to cook pozole and tamales to cook 7 dozen tamales it takes a minimum of 2 hours on medium heat. Cook the tamales on high heat for 4 12 to 6 hours. Then prepare the corn husks and wrap the tamales which can be a fun activity for your family and guests.",
