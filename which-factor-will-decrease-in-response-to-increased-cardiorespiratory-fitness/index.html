<p>These pressure receptors are important. 1507 students attemted this question. There is some evidence that cardiorespiratory fitness levels are inversely correlated with metabolic risk in European and North-American youth 12 suggesting that high physical fitness attenuates. Answers to question. Which factor will decrease in response to increased cardiorespiratory fitness. Decrease in bone mass d.</p>

<p>Also chemical factors such as a decrease in oxygen concentration and an increase in carbon dioxide or lactic acid concentration in the blood promote vasodilatation to increase blood flow. Which factor will decrease in response to increased cardiorespiratory fitness. THIS USER ASKED. Decrease in oxygen intake b. This rapid decrease in plasma volume suggests that it is ﬂuid shifts rather than ﬂuid loss that accounts for the initial decrease in plasma volume Wade and Freund 1990. Decrease in muscle mass c.</p>
