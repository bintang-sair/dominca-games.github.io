<h3 id="for-hcl-the-proton-is-attached-to-a-more-electronegative-atom-cl-than-in-nh3-where-the-proton-is-attached-to-an-n">For HCl the proton is attached to a more electronegative atom Cl than in NH3 where the proton is attached to an N.</h3>
<p>IV III 1 11 111 IV V. So it will increase smt of the molecule Barcia three groups that plus I effect. Which will be the most acidic hydrogen in both cases. Thus the acidity order is H b H c H a. According to me in the first compound 2 should be most acidic as in both 1 and 2 resonance occurs but 2s carbon is closer to the oxygen which can stabilize the negative charge on carbon. So it will destabilize the negative chance which is formed after releasing of edge.</p>
