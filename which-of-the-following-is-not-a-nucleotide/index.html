<p>Cyclic adenosine monophosphate d. These are all examples of nucleotides. A nucleotide does not contain phospholipids. Which of the following is not a nucleotide. The three components of a nucleotide are a 5-carbon sugar a phosphate group and a nitrogenous base. Overall protein synthesis consists of these steps.</p>

<p>Which of the following is not present in a nucleotide. Cannot be used for an energy source. If 15 of the nucleotide in a DNA molecule contains guanine what percentage of the nucleotides contain each of the other three bases the 15 is cytosine because they are equal and 35 each thymine and adenine. DNA molecules serve as the templates for mRNA. Which of the following is not part of the structure of a nucleotide. MRNA molecules move to ribosomes.</p>
