    "description": "In transformation a bacterium takes up a piece of DNA floating in its environment. In olfaction transduction occurs as airborne chemicals that are inhaled through the nostrils are detected by receptors in the olfactory membrane. Transposable elements are chunks of DNA that jump from one place to another. Many signal transduction pathways amplify the initial signal so that one molecule of ligand can lead to the activation of many molecules of a downstream target. Signal transduction occurs as a result of a ligand binding to the outside region of the receptor the ligand does not pass through the membrane.",

<p><strong>Where Does Transduction Occur</strong>. However non-protein molecules like ions and phospholipids can also play important roles. The visible cycle is the organic conversion of a photon into an electrical sign within the retina. In transduction DNA is accidentally moved from one bacterium to another by a virus. The retina a thin layer of cells located on the inner surface of the back of the eye consists of photoreceptive cells which are responsible for the transduction of light into nervous impulses. In the auditory system sound vibrations mechanical energy are transduced into electrical energy by hair cells in the inner ear.</p>

<p>Sound vibrations from an object cause vibrations in air molecules which in turn vibrate the ear drum. In olfaction transduction occurs as airborne chemicals that are inhaled through the nostrils are detected by receptors in the olfactory membrane. Where does transduction occur in the ear. Also know how is transduction accomplished in the inner ear. Where does transduction occur in the nose. Visual phototransduction occurs in the retina through photoreceptors cells that are sensitive to light.</p>
<h3 id="where-does-transduction-occur-in-the-cell">Where does transduction occur in the cell.</h3>
<p>The site of transduction is in the organ of Corti the spiral organ. Sensory loss can occur due to a minor nick or lesion on the spinal cord which creates a problem within the neurosystem. Many signal transduction pathways amplify the initial signal so that one molecule of ligand can lead to the activation of many molecules of a downstream target. Likewise where does transduction occur in the body. Cochlea- the inner ear. Where does transduction occur in the eyes.</p>
