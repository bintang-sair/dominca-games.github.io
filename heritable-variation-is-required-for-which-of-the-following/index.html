<p><strong>Heritable Variation Is Required For Which Of The Following</strong>. Evolution is change that is heritable across generations. In biology evolution is the change in the inherited traits of a population from generation to generation. Heritability estimates range in value from 0 to 1. These forces influence the patterns of genetic variation. Either through asexual reproduction or sexual reproduction the offspring cells or organisms acquire the genetic information of their parents.</p>
