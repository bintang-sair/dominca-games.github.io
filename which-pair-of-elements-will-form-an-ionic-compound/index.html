<p>K and I gains one electron to form I. K and Cl C. For example the metal calcium Ca and the nonmetal chlorine Cl form the ionic compound calcium chloride CaCl 2. This contrasts with ionic compounds which usually involve bonds between metal ions and nonmetal ions. In general the elements that combine to form binary molecular compounds are both nonmetals. Oxygen forms the oxide to minus signs so this would form a non metal iron.</p>
