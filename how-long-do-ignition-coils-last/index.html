    "description": "If you eliminate the bad batch mid 2002 - mid 2004 I believe coil reliablity is good. Im currently at 153k miles with original coil packs. There are a number of factors that can lead to this part become damaged prematurely. The fact is you dont change them unless theyre bad generally they give a lifetime of service without going bad I seen several GMs last a lifetime of the car 300 400 thousand miles and Ive seen others like Fords which are all in one block which means you have to change the whole thing and its kind of got a module built into it and dont fail on one or two cylinders generally paired. Most of the newer cars on the market have a hard plastic cover.",
