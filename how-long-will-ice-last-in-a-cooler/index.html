A lot of coolers will throw out fantastic claims for ice to last up to 10 days but that is in perfect conditions. In our experience this is a bit of an overshoot. The larger sizes of these coolers are stated to last for up to 5 days before the ice melts. For instance 10 pounds of dry ice will last about 24 hours in a 25-quart cooler.",
