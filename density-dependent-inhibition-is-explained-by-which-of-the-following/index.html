A growth inhibiting signal is sent to both cells preventing them from dividing. The number of cells per unit area at which this occurs is higher than the density at which a monolayer is formed confluent culture indicating that this is not a contact-mediated phenomenon unlike contact inhibition of locomotion.",

<p><strong>Density Dependent Inhibition Is Explained By Which Of The Following</strong>. The number of cells per unit area at which this occurs is higher than the density at which a monolayer is formed confluent culture indicating that this is not a contact-mediated phenomenon unlike contact inhibition of locomotion. AAs cells become more numerousthey begin to squeeze against each otherrestricting their size and ability to produce growth factors. B As cells become more numerous the cell surface proteins of one cell contact the adjoining cells and they stop dividing. The cessation of cell division that occurs once cells in culture reach a critical density topoinhibition. A density dependent inhibition is when cells become more and more numerous the required growth factors and nutrients become insufficient making cell growth difficult.</p>

<p>Company Policies And Procedures ManualInformation The following document is a complete set of Policies Procedures and has been prepared for Sample Company. Competitive inhibition can be explained by which of the following models. A As cells become more numerous they begin to squeeze against each other restricting their size and ability to produce control factorsB As cells become more numerous the level of waste products increases eventually slowing down C As cells become more numerous the protein kinases. This phenomenon involves binding of a cell-surface protein to its counterpart on an adjoining cells surface.
