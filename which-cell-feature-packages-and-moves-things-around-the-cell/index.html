To choose specific options when you paste cells you can click the arrow below Paste and then click the option that you want. This phospholipid bilayer determines what molecules can move into or out of the cell and so is in large part responsible for maintaining the delicate homeostasis of each cell. Controls what moves in and out of the cell - cytoplasm control center of the cell - nucleus large storage structure - vacuole all cellular material outside the nucleus - plasma membrane functional plant or animal - cell wall outer covering around a plant cell.",

<p>Receives proteins and materials from the ER packages them and distributes them. Cytoplasm also helps to move things around in the cells such as hormones and dissolves any cellular waste that may occur. Fibrous proteins that occur in the cytoplasm referred to as the cytoskeleton maintain the shape of the cell as well as anchoring organelles moving the cell and controlling internal movement of structures. The entire cell is surrounded by a thin ce membrane. Most of the time referencing a cell in Excel is super easy. However there are certain features common to all cells.</p>
